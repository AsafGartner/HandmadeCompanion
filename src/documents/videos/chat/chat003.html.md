    "30:20": "elxenoaizd Q: Is there any way to reverse engineer a pack file and figure out how it's laid out, like Resident Evil MD1 files on PlayStation?"
    "31:52": "cubercaleb Q: Why do you think that memory mapped files are a bad idea?"
    "32:11": "thegiallo Q: Does Steam allow to patch files instead of overwrite them? So could one patch the one data file, having an update that is not a practically full reinstall?"
    "33:53": "elxenoaizd Q: Any ideas or thoughts about those anti-piracy ideas they implemented in GTA, Serious Sam and other games where the game trolls the players and becomes super hard and even impossible to beat if the cracked version is used?"
    "36:20": "longboolean Q: I've been thinking about how to implement water reflections in a top down 2D game. What do you think about using render layers like: (bottom -> top) water, reflection, land, shadows, objects / things, then combining the layers?"
    "36:50": "Captainkraft Q: Do you have any idea for hardware architecture design that could improve performance for games?"
    "38:42": "snovind92 Q: Under development and before the release of a PC game, are there good practices for making sure that a game will work on an end user's machine and not get bugs caused by users' hardware?"
    "41:27": "pragmascrypt Q: Do you have to go through the Steam Greenlight process in Steam for your game? Do you think its a good idea?"
    "42:21": "garryjohanson Q: If you had an easy way to write whatever code you wanted on the GPU, would you write your own renderer and never use OpenGL again?"
    "42:41": "thegiallo Q: So all the huge updates I continuously have on Steam are dev faults! Like 35GB over 35GB of clean install. Do you know what was the 1GB update of The Witness for? I was wondering why it was so huge so early"
    "43:59": "cubercaleb Q: How do you feel about DRM schemes like Denuvo that take a considerable amount of CPU time during game play and add to hard disk writes which is bad for SSDs?"
    "44:21": "elxenoaizd Q: I was just curious in my question how some games know if the player is playing a legitimate vs cracked version? Where they crank the difficulty level and make it impossible for cracked version to beat. They use some sort of DLL versioning / signature, or...?"

Couple of questions: 1) So I guess they did something similar to reflections to implement real-time shadows? 2) How did they achieve other effects like camera panning and lightning? 3) You still need an invisible level collision mesh, correct?"
    "1:04:27": "Phazyck Q: What if you are constrained on space as well as computing power? Could you pre-compute parts of your graphics, e.g. a shape from multiple angles of 5 degrees, and then do interpolation to get values that lie in between, e.g. a view of the shape at 7 degrees?"

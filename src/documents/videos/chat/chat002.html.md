    "0:43": "trevnewt Q: What are the pros and cons of \"baking\" assets like images into your executable, rather than shipping them separately and loading them dynamically?"

    "9:13": "insofaras Q: I meant using the built in windows voice recognition stuff to program Handmade Hero"
    "9:29": "cubercaleb Q: Do you think you could create an in depth video / post on IOCP at some point in the near future? I am having a bit of trouble understanding their amazing-ness"
    "9:54": "Elxenoaizd Q: Good evening Sensei! I hope your hand is feeling better today! I salute your positiveness in handling the situation. I would totally freak out if that happens to me, without programming I'm practically useless"
    "11:34": "dangalf_ Q: After fiction technology, what are some candidates for another problem / project worth your time?"
    "12:10": "pragmascrypt Q: Will there ever be good realtime global illumination"
    "12:56": "protongaming Q: Why are companies so hard with junior developers in the interview process. Make it very difficult for inexperienced coders to get a job"
    "13:44": "x13pixels Q: Is Martins still putting the videos up on BitTorrent Sync?"
    "14:28": "ejunkie64 Q: You could try something like chi gung (Chinese health exercise) which could help with RSI and creating a good posture. Just a thought"
    "14:59": "remurr Q: Do you ever wonder if a game you're playing will turn into Frog Fractions 2 with a crazy twist? I find myself wondering this often"
    "15:10": "ingenero Q: For some reason I remember you saying there were changes coming to the handmadehero.org forums. Did I remember correctly, and do you have any updates on the current status?"
    "16:09": "danyguag Q: What is that Intel Architecture thing on your desktop? [see Resouces]"
    "19:00": "garlandobloom	Q: Have you ever been to GDC?"
    "19:31": "garlandobloom	Q: Why is audio such a disaster even on windows?"
    "20:21": "cubercaleb Q: Don't installer programs typically bake information about the program they are installing into the exe? Is that how installers are typically done on the Windows?"
    "20:44": "Blackboard: Making an installer"
    "24:33": "nightbasilisk Q: Is making an interesting \"game AI\" considered a very hard problem or are people just lazy? I see most games come with terrible AI these days; why does it seem we're going backwards?"
    "25:21": "garlandobloom Q: Is there any difference between exe installers and msi installers?"
    "26:27": "raley91 Q: I'm no doctor but couldn't be that the wrist braces you use are actually making your muscles in that part weaker?"
    "27:26": "garryjohanson Q: Possibly too big of a question, but is there an ideal known strategy to make a natural language processing system, e.g. you type English and that parses into actions then enacted by your program?"
    "28:57": "garryjohanson Q: We could do an experiment where you tell us what to make and you review?"
    "29:22": "sssmcgrath Q: Have you spoken to Chris Crawford about IF?"
    "30:05": "imminent_threat Q: How would you describe your learning curve over your decades of programming experience? For me, no matter how long I do something, I always seem to look back to where I was a year before, and feel like that was a much less competent version of myself"
    "31:48": "insofaras Q: Have you played Starship Titanic? I thought that had quite a cool interactive conversation thing, especially for a 1998 game"
    "32:16": "elxenoaizd Q: Related to the question about embedded resources vs external ones: I had an idea of using a meta program to load a model during a preprocessor step and spits out the code that assigns the vertices values directly to an array, i.e. void LoadModel(v3 *Vertices) { Vertices[0].x = ...; Vertices[0].y = ....; } etc. Do you think that's useful in any way?"
    "33:44": "cvaucher Q: Might be jumping the gun since we haven't gotten to shaders, but I'm having trouble with them in my renderer. Am I supposed to save the attributes and shader programs across draw calls, or reinitialize each time? Seems like you went to a lot of trouble to remove the transient arena from the OpenGL renderer so things can't be pushed from there"
    "35:43": "thesizik Q: What PDF reader is that?"
    "35:57": "elxenoaizd Q: Why is it in C++ that people always like and do many compilation units, one for each .cpp file? Is it just because it's how visual studio build works?"
    "37:14": "cubercaleb Q: Won't Anti-Viruses get finicky with you writing to the end of an exe? Doesn't that also break code signing?"
    "38:15": "cubercaleb Q: Is it practical to roll your own C runtime? From what I have gathered there seems to be a lot of problems with that sort of thing. Of course M$ has the audacity to ship incompatible versions of the CRT on different versions of Windows. Any workarounds for this?"
    "38:55": "boondoggle42 Q: Have you considered guest programmers for the interim?"
    "39:31": "That's it for tonight"

    "43:04": "thisdrunkdane Q: How to battle the urge to have 100 different small projects around and stay focused on a single project?"
    "48:10": "Always finish a project"
    "49:15": "Some potential value in having more than one project"
    "51:19": "mr4thdimention Q: (This is slightly related to one thing you said) I have been getting the feeling that programmers in general are bad at taking objective measurements of things like \"how good am I?\", with maybe the exception of how long a chunk of code takes. Would you agree with that assessment and do you think we suffer a lot because of it?"
    "55:12": "tinyconstruct Q: Somewhat related / a final update on the TA we talked about. His talk on ray tracer efficiency when he got to the GPU side of things basically broke down into \"Use OptiX, GPU programming is hard.\" So... I don't even know, dude"
    "56:55": "burgerlove_ Q: Let's say you are someone who is really drawn to starting and growing your own projects in a tough industry like this. While some people are getting experience at big studios, you're fighting through the details of smaller projects. Do you think in the long run it could really hurt you because of how you look on paper?"
    "59:28": "jasperps Q: My largest frustration currently is that large sections of my code currently get rejected or rewritten in review. Is there are anything I can do proactively to help myself write more efficient code, i.e. teach myself how to approach some problems better? A lot of the patterns I used regularly are turning out to be sub-optimal"
    "1:01:55": "thisdrunkdane Q: By the way, I thought the Molly Rocket office didn't have internet?"
    "1:03:11": "empiretycoon Q: Hey Casey! I'm new to programming, have been studying Information System for two years. My problem is, I can't start projects at all, I always get stuck and by the end of the day I get nothing done. All that I wanted was to start something to improve my skills. Been following the stream for a while, what should I do?"
    "1:05:04": "remele Q: What is the thought process behind not having the internet? Is it for staying on task (avoiding distraction) or for some other reason? How do you look up documentation and things of that nature?"
    "1:09:47": "hoshoyo Q: Do you think web programmers simply don't aspire to be better programmers, don't know what good programming is or simply don't care? What should we do to unchain their minds from this evil?"
    "1:14:15": "Shared delusion in web programming"
    "1:16:37": "empiretycoon Q: For example, one day I decided to write a small game in an engine, but instead of doing that I spent the whole day reading through the engine documentation and video tutorials. By the end of the day I got nothing accomplished and got burned out on it"

    "1:08:06": "Stream spots a typo!"
    "1:08:37": "Stream suggests to assert the bitmap assertion mode!"
    "1:09:12": "You do not need #pragma intrinsic if you include <intrin.h>"
    "1:10:53": "Would it be worthwhile to avoid converting to float while doing the alpha blend?"
    "1:12:46": "Why is the Windows-logo still visible at the top?"
    "1:14:11": "Are there other ways to alpha blend and should you be taking into account which colors are easier to see?"
    "1:21:06": "Are we at all concerned with the destinations alpha?"
    "1:25:28": "Will the final blend favor the source over the destination, or is linear good enough?"
    "1:25:59": "How would you deal with other picture formats such as png, jpeg, etc."
    "1:26:53": "Why is the mask so complicated to use?"
    "1:27:51": "Did you mean the other compiler LLVM or Clang?"
    "1:28:37": "In the bitscan function what about returning index negative one if not found?"
    "1:29:04": "Can you go over the linear alpha blend diagram again?"
    "1:34:36": "Is the large VirtualAlloc() at the beginning similar to Linux mmap()?"
    "1:35:51": "What bitvalue is 50% brightness?"
    "1:37:34": "Does the display bitmap operation actually do anything with the alpha channel?"
    "1:37:58": "The solid curve on Wikipedias gamma correction is the linear space intencity. Should be what you're looking for."

* 441\. That's actually not our fault -- that's just actually this code being wrong! (24:45)
* 442\. Here's a thought. And you can tell me what you think of this thought; of the thinking behind this thought (34:00)
* 443\. Look at that. So lovely (40:23)
* 445\. I am super double happy with how that went. I am a happy puppy (41:56)

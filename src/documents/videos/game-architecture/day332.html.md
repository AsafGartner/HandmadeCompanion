    "1:05:31": "internal_static_void Q: Is internal a #define static internal"
    "1:05:39": "anonymous519 Q: Could you talk a bit about the metaprogramming stuff you use at work? I'm kind of annoyed at the limitations of C/C++ and it looks like the JAI compiler won't be released anytime soon. Do you actually parse the code and construct an AST, or is it simpler than that?"
    "1:05:57": "internal_static_void Q: Also, are you a fan of templates or do you use void * instead"
    "1:06:09": "mr4thdimention Q: Why was the grouping approach for speeding up the debug sorting the first one you tried? Would it have been better in some way?"
    "1:08:31": "internal_static_void Q: So would you recommend using a .bat file or bash script over a cmake file, for instance"
    "1:09:41": "internal_static_void Q: And finally, at your work are there any people that program in OOP, or are they shunned and thrown out?"
    "1:11:04": "dr_s80 Q: Related to yesterday's sim region issue, would it be feasible to merge overlapping regions, and then make a pass to slice it back up into non-overlapping regions?"
    "1:11:30": "sean_bryant Q: Can you imagine any scenarios where batched rendering might be useful in Handmade Hero?"
    "1:12:06": "anonymous519 Q: I've only recently started to think about metaprogramming. Not expecting you to go in-depth, but could you briefly list some of the features you've implemented?"
    "1:12:24": "longboolean Q: Will you be composing the music / SFX for Handmade Hero (if any) or do you have someone else doing that?"
    "1:14:44": "That's about it"

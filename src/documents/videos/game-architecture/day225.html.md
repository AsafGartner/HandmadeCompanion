    "55:44": "m1el Q: Casey, you need one more state to wait for alpha-enabled window to show, because you might have the same bug when you fade to desktop"
    "57:25": "SteelGolem Q: Your fading setup seems overcomplicated to me. Why not just take a screenshot, blit that to the back buffer, and fade that? What platforms wouldn't that work for?"
    "1:00:26": "insofaras Q: Why are you using a second window for the fade in, instead of just fading in the main window?"
    "1:02:06": "Miblo Q: Wow, thank you for such a comprehensive A: to my Q:. That's exactly what I wanted! Another small one: Would it be possible to make bits of the window transparent, e.g. for the situation where some monstar has torn a hole in the game window, revealing the desktop beneath?"
    "1:03:31": "Mr4thDimention Q: Suppose you're Microsoft, but instead of wanting all of the money in the world you just want to make a living selling your OS. Do you think you could do that while providing a good way for users of your platform to debug the code that uses your API?"
    "1:05:17": "insofaras Q: Can you not unset the layered window flag after doing the fade?"
    "1:07:15": "SteelGolem Q: Wait, why can I Alt-PrintScreen to capture HDCP with windows but I can't take a screencap manually? I have lots of screenshots of my PS3 through the player via prntscrnt"
    "1:08:53": "blah238 Q: So this detour was all about startup and shutdown fades, but how would you implement fading in between in-game scenes? This shouldn't involve the Windows API, correct?"
    "1:09:25": "handmade_cutscene.h: Add tFadeIn to layered_scene"
    "1:10:35": "handmade_cutscene.cpp: Implement fade to black between cutscene shots"

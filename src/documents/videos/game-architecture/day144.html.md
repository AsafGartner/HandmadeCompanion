    "01:16:55": "When you implemented streaming in chunks of audio; I believe the code actually loads the entire file (with a platform layer VirtualAlloc) for each chunk. Is this just an artifact of the debug nature of that code?"
    "01:17:33": "Does the audio make the framerate in debug mode?"
    "01:26:09": "If 1111 (-1) is supposed to be less than 0000 (0) then how do number comparisons work on the CPU level?"
    "01:32:39": "Do you have any tips for speeding up compile time when using multiple translation units?"
    "01:32:55": "It's movsx for signed"

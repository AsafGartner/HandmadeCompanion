    "57:44": "Q&A"
    "58:52": "Q: For zooming out, could you somehow modify MetersToPixels to make things smaller as you zoom?"
    "59:39": "Q: What is inline v2?"
    "1:01:04": "Q: Why use Emacs versus Visual Studio's IDE?"
    "1:02:36": "Q: Is Emacs better than Vim, or is it just preference?"
    "1:03:43": "Q: Do you think that how fast code runs is the best metric for good code, or do you value simplicity or extensibility as well?"
    "1:05:59": "Q: Why are you using Visual Studio here if you use Emacs?"
    "1:06:34": "swagkitty69 Q: Did you ever figure out a fix for Emacs whenever you try to create a new file and the patch changes?"
    "1:07:03": "Q: What's guiding you to make steps towards completing the game, i.e. a list of requirements for the game?"
    "1:08:54": "Q: Do you ever get annoyed with reading a high depth of nested for loops?"
    "1:09:55": "Q: Was watching some ROM hacking earlier and watching the registers and memory update in real time was really cool. Do you think a debugger for C could work as well as that?"
    "1:10:39": "Q: How much time do you spend outside the stream in thinking about the code and game design? If you coded eight hours a day, would you be able to code consistently with the same pace as during your stream?"
    "1:11:38": "Q: Can you please put in a proper PRNG before you write world gen algorithms?"
    "1:12:46": "Q: Do you ever feel the need to use recursive functions?"
    "1:13:15": "Q: Do you build with build.exe in command prompt or batch file?"
    "1:14:11": "Q: When you say \"renderer\", what exactly does that mean? If the drawing you have now isn't rendering, then at what point do we go from drawing to rendering?"
    "1:15:55": "Q: Have any of your friends voiced disagreement with design decisions you've made in this engine?"
    "1:16:22": "Q: How do you distinguish between what a lot of people might called \"premature optimisation\" versus ensuring a good design that allows for high performance? The difference there seems really subtle. I feel that designing for high performance is simply organising the code and writing in such a way that does not unnecessarily slow down the code and prevent future optimisations, while premature optimisation is simply optimising something because you think something will be slow without evidence"
    "1:19:52": "Q: 4096 random numbers"
    "1:20:03": "Q: Will we have positionless entities? Would something like the current price of Almond Milk futures be an entity?"
    "1:20:22": "Q: Will you be making a level / tile map editor for this game, for easier level creation?"
    "1:20:40": "Q: What is your algorithm for a collision with three and more entities?"
    "1:21:21": "Blackboard: Moving in 1/30th sec"
    "1:23:15": "Q: Do you plan to use some form of logging for debugging purposes?"
    "1:23:48": "Q: When you remove a LowEntity from the Chunk list, you swap another into its place. Won't that mess with references?"
    "1:24:15": "happy_vertex Q: Even for slow frequency entities?"
    "1:24:59": "We have come to the end of the questions"

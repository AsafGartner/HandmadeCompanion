    "1:03:19": "StrickenDown Q: I am new to programming and know intermediate Java only. Can you explain what you use emacs for if you're using Visual Studio?"
    "1:03:49": "cubercaleb Q: I think you should move the skylight up a tad bit"
    "1:04:10": "garlandobloom Q: I feel like we should have some deep voice narration. \"Eown in the valley...\""
    "1:04:31": "Ownageinacannn Q: Did you ever have trouble while learning to program? I'm currently getting my rump handed to me in my Java class"
    "1:05:29": "elxenoaizd Q: Will we ever load png files? If so, will we be writing our own loader or use stb_image.h? I read that it's tricky to load pngs or no?"
    "1:05:54": "dsJimEnez Q: Will your cutscenes be coded like this, or be setup as data in a separate file?"
    "1:06:21": "broxx909 Q: Do you need to know in-depth linear alegebra to do this?"
    "1:06:42": "elxenoaizd Q: You mentioned your codebase is mostly independent for the most part: does that include random number generation or do you use the C library for that?"
    "1:07:12": "elxenoaizd Q: How do you handle 3D audio in your other engines and games? OpenAL or you implement something yourself?"
    "1:07:57": "garlandobloom Q: The sky-light just has a gap at the top was all"

    HERE ARE ALL THE Qs, IN CASE YOU NEED TO COPY ANY OF THEM
    Ikkir_Isth Q: Well, youve got the art pack in, are you getting voicework for the game as well? (community voices? we could knockout voices for the intro :) )
    TheSizik Q: Should move sky light up a bit
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    boondoggle42 Q: Does Chartreuse hand delivered from Catalonia taste any different?
    
    serge_rgb Q: (not really a question) You are now a real life version of @BobRossGameDev
    
    
    Jayp2 Q: Have you talked further with Pat Wyatt about coming on the stream? Or is that postponed for when networking becomes relevant? I thought his talk was very interesting in particular
    CaptainKraft Q: is this code going to be for a cinematic in the game or are you just testing the functionality now?
    Kaminate Q: Should I use uint32_t over u32?
    blah238 Q: what do you think about adding lighting effects to the cutscene, like a flickering or pulsing of the candlelight in the welcome sign?
    Stevoid1990 Q: blah238: what do you think about adding lighting effects to the cutscene, like a flickering or pulsing of the candlelight in the welcome sign?
    elxenoaizd Q: I meant the image format before we pack them in asset, i understand we're currently using BMP.
    insofaras Q: for adding more cutscenes or modding, wouldn't it make more sense to keep the parallax constants somewhere in the hha file?
    cubercaleb Q: Don't you need to link to user32, gdi32 and opengl32 for a few things?
    btnGames Q: After speaking to Tommy, are you considering routing these art files through Flash / JSFL? j/k
    elxenoaizd Q: if you're writing OpenGL stuff, do you use GLEW or write your own extension loader and load the function pointers yourself?
    Longboolean Q: You could make a 2d VR game, just room with a giant video wall.
    btnGames Q: Off topic - Thank you for HandmadeCon, I have watched it twice already :)
    PurposelyDrifting Q: not a question. Just wanted to thank you for doing handmade con! And glad to see you back doing handmade hero.
    SerialQwiller Q: Yes, Handmade con was a great event. Thank you
    fwe4 Q: any plans for crude lighting and shadow support for things like lightposts?
    groggeh Q: will you show all content creation on stream too? Watching you spend hours doing cutsecenes might not be fun
    btnGames Q: Out of interest, if you wanted to implement a zoom that curved to the contours of the hill (forward, drop, forward), would you still look to implement that in code or look at a visual tool for something like that?
    theGeekPirate Q: Thanks for the stream Casey.
    Ownageinacannn Q: Did you have to study algorithms in depth or did you learn from on-hand experience?
    elxenoaizd Q: Carmack and Barrett for HMC2016?
    groggeh Q: is vsync part of the renderer? at least on my end on the stream there is quite a bit of tearing. not sure if that is the stream or not
    CaptainKraft Q: have any of the responses to your questions at handmade con affected your approach to certain problems?
    btnGames Q: Was the snowman intentionally looking down to indicate a feeling of sadness, or am I reading too much into it?
    elxenoaizd Q: I just fixed a collision bug that was driving me insane. feels good :D
    ciutchism Q: Has a programming problem ever stumped you? Even after googling and or collab?
    elxenoaizd Q: when you were an intermediate programmer how often it is that you use google to help you look up solutions to hard problems? or do you always try to first approach it yourslef?
    CaptainKraft Q: did you notice the triforce in the windows?
    ChronalDragon Q: It may be obvious but there is entire class of programmers that seem to think otherwise
    Pseudonym73 Q: One of my mentors used to say that there should be a book called \"Algorithms, Data Structures, and Tradeoffs\".
    ciutchism Q: Makes sense. Was more of wondering if you gave up trying to write the code because of limitations of either your engine, code, or ability.
    cubercaleb Q: well, there is now proof that majora's mask is amazing
    btnGames Q: As always, another amazing stream!
    Connor_Rentz Q: thanks Casey! It was a pleasure coding with you, as a

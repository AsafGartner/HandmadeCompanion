    "54:30": "Q&A"
    "55:08": "On split-screen what kind of resolution were you thinking for each?"
    "56:15": "You once said visualizing problems is never a wasted effort. Should we use it for collision detection?"
    "56:52": "Are entities just for players or all game objects?"
    "57:23": "How input be handled when both players trigger an action at the same time?"
    "57:46": "Who is the camera following with multiple players? [code change]"
    "1:00:44": "When you decided to have multiple players you decided to call them entities. Why?"
    "1:01:56": "How do you make the characters not run through the trees?"
    "1:03:50": "Why are we doing physical based movement?"
    "1:04:37": "Will we be doing any image manipulation with code?"
    "1:04:47": "Any reason to catch failing to load art assets? [code change]"
    "1:06:54": "Is the notion of having all entities in a single array something that'll stay for long?"
    "1:07:22": "Why do you not use an auto-compiler?"
    "1:07:51": "How would disconnected controllers mid-game gracefully handled?"
    "1:08:53": "When comparing a float to zero shouldn't we be checking withing a tolerance instead?"
    "1:09:26": "Will there be diagonal movement sprites to the hero?"
    "1:10:29": "Since small velocities were brought up, will we account for small inputs i.e. deadzones?"
    "1:12:01": "About storing entities in an array. If there's massive operations on many of them, can this be exploited?"
    "1:13:03": "Why didn't we use the bitmap masks directly?"
    "1:15:22": "Are there any games that you've personally developed that are available to the public?"
    "1:17:39": "Why do you use the function call macros?"
    "1:18:33": "Will you wait for Jon to finish his presentation tomorrow?"
    "1:18:54": "Can you explain what you mean by 'deadzone on the controller'?"
    "1:22:54": "Do controllers have an outside deadzone?"
    "1:23:58": "Addition to bitmap loading question: 'You && with a 32bit value and use what you get'"
    "1:26:31": "Can you ever talk about the code you made that shipped 2000+ times?"
    "1:28:00": "Will we be using a component system?"
    "1:28:20": "Any estimation where GUIs will appear?"
    "1:28:55": "Chat says: there are rotation instructions "
    "1:33:05": "[code change: Using rotation instructions]"
    "1:39:45": "Rotate will work but it's microcoded, so don't use them if you want performance"
    "1:40:16": "Doesn't the rotate mess with the XP compatibility?"
    "1:40:54": "Pondering about microcode speed"

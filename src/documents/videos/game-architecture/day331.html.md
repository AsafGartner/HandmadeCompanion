    "56:16": "jayphi Q: What are the reasons for separate regions again?"
    "57:41": "Pseudonym Q: Is Bob the guy in the tree?"
    "57:46": "JamesWidman Q: (Related to JayPhi's Q) So I was playing Kingdom: New Lands recently, and it seemed like there were some really bad frame rates that coincided with battles involving hundreds of entities on the opposite side of the world... (like, opposite to where the camera was)"
    "59:38": "insofaras Q: Have you considered only merging with the hero's region, and deactivating ones past that, or having the regions aligned to a grid / rooms, so they don't overlap?"
    "1:01:22": "Blackboard: Active Region + Apron"
    "1:03:03": "terrorscout Q: Could you have smaller regions and load nine active at a time so you always have every boundary region loaded all the time?"
    "1:05:31": "Blackboard: On needing to load a part of adjacent regions"
    "1:06:11": "cyberpunkhobo Q: Couldn't you just make sure regions that get pulled in by the apron don't have their own apron activated?"
    "1:08:08": "Blackboard: Time-slicing and merging with only one overlapping region"
    "1:09:42": "jayphi Q: What is the actual problem again when two active regions overlap?"
    "1:10:55": "Mr4thDimention Q: You could always artificially keep the non-player agents away from each other"
    "1:11:13": "thesizik Q: What do you think about a boolean flag on each update-able thing, flip it when you update, and alternate each frame which value you check for?"
    "1:12:10": "JamesWidman Q: Why does it not suffice to use the total area of all overlapped regions (and just refuse to exceed a limit)?"
    "1:13:40": "Close this down"

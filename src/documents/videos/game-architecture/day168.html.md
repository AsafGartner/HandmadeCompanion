    "1:20:29": "noxy_key Q: Would printing text to a separate bitmap background be easier than putting it straight on top of the game background?"
    "1:20:42": "insofaras Q: Nice, that was very quick to implement"
    "1:20:50": "Vavassor Q: How about a 2D array of function pointers? Might have been why a few of those variants didn't compile because it thought you were declaring a function pointer array (*Foo)"
    "1:21:01": "IxNoxidexI Q: Around how many more episodes until the switch from software rendering to hardware rendering?"

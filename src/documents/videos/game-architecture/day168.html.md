    "54:11": "Q&A"
    "54:34": "Kelimion Q: Will you be addressing the subscript, superscript, en-space, em-space and other types of space tomorrow as well?"
    "56:33": "BrainCruser Q: Will you add edges to the font?"
    "57:00": "Renroh Q: What's the difference between making a game in C++ and making a game in Java?"
    "59:40": "BrainCruser Q: Yes outlines"
    "1:00:06": "Robrobby Q: Hi Casey, question on the array you typed and pulled out again: u32 char[ ][ 2 ] <-- Is this an array with pairs of u32's? I would have expected u32[ [ ], [ ] ]"
    "1:00:22": "Doing arrays in C"
    "1:06:27": "Reading C declarations"
    "1:13:26": "insofaras Q: Will you implement colored text, and would the color info be embedded in the text itself like Quake used to use ^1 for red?"
    "1:14:08": "cubercaleb Q: Do programmers actually use that crazy array semantics that you just showed off?"
    "1:15:05": "insofaras Q: You didn't answer the bit about how if the color info would be embedded in the text as control codes or not"
    "1:16:41": "Implement colour code parsing"
    "1:20:21": "BrainCruser Q: In some object oriented languages things can become that complicated"
    "1:20:29": "noxy_key Q: Would printing text to a separate bitmap background be easier than putting it straight on top of the game background?"
    "1:20:42": "insofaras Q: Nice, that was very quick to implement"
    "1:20:50": "Vavassor Q: How about a 2D array of function pointers? Might have been why a few of those variants didn't compile because it thought you were declaring a function pointer array (*Foo)"
    "1:21:01": "IxNoxidexI Q: Around how many more episodes until the switch from software rendering to hardware rendering?"
    "1:21:23": "cubercaleb Q: Can you rotate and transform the text?"
    "1:22:57": "Implement font scale code parsing"
    "1:24:50": "Stream has ended"

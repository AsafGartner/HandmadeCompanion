    "46:53": "Q&A"
    "47:45": "Cubercaleb Q: There is a bug in the new GL code, the if(!) you added is not checking the sRGB variable but a different one"
    "54:12": "Garryjohanson Q: Totally serious when I say you should write an API book. I would never think of lots of stuff"
    "55:20": "SoysauceTheKid Q: For the keyboard / gamepad inputs, can HalfTransitionCount ever go beyond 1? Or is it there if you put the input getting on a separate thread?"
    "57:40": "Cubercaleb Q: Kind of graphics / Windows related: Why do so many games, especially Source games handle Alt-Tab poorly?"
    "1:00:31": "Cynokron Q: Is there any benefit to moving the main windows message queue to another thread? I'm sorry if you've implemented / answered this already. I'm still catching up"
    "1:05:07": "gasto5 Q: Do you use Windows's GDI outside of the educational usage you have been showing?"
    "1:07:26": "Fyoucon Q: Promote 4coder!"
    "1:07:31": "guitarm87 Q: Sounds like you know how to play drums?"
    "1:07:38": "Cynokron Q: What do you think of Vulkan? Will it replace D3D?"
    "1:10:17": "stelar7 Q: Selection buffer vs ray picking vs color picking for mouse picking?"
    "1:10:33": "SoysauceTheKid Q: For detecting long presses on keyboards, would I put a timestamp in the input struct?"
    "1:10:55": "APlethora Q: What is the next \"feature\" you are going to work on?"
    "1:11:06": "dgmtv Q: Do you think all the modern C++ nomenclatures like C++11, C++14, C++17, C++xy are an internal joke to obscure the mess the language is?"
    "1:12:48": "cubercaleb Q: Is it worth selling my soul and learning JS / Python for money?"
    "1:14:48": "joshuanatrop Q: Any thoughts on SDL2?"
    "1:14:56": "slay29 Q: What technique are you going to use for path-finding?"
    "1:15:03": "ltdemian Q: Been doing a lot of JS. What do you think I should do next? Kind of bored with JS"
    "1:15:36": "TheBuzzSaw Q: Vulkan is extremely low level; that was requested by various game engine and hardware developers. There is probably a huge market for a dev-friendly API to sit on top of Vulkan to shield devs from those gory details. Don't think so?"
    "1:19:29": "gasto5 Q:How much do you follow the latest technologies? Do you think it is a waste of time to learn the latest graphics API for indie development?"
    "1:23:26": "erdomina Q: Why should no programmer work for Palantir?"
    "1:24:36": "guitarm87 Q: Does Jon use more C++ specific stuff than yours do?"
    "1:25:58": "iWumbo_ Q: What you think about the new Snowdrop game engine?"
    "1:26:24": "cubercaleb Q: Do you plan on using Vulkan considering the performance differences that people have been claiming exist?"
    "1:27:37": "balreign Q: Since you write everything from scratch, why not use a language like Go?"
    "1:28:04": "sanch3z1337 Q: If any, what games have you been playing recently and how did you like them?"
    "1:28:38": "imperiumtactics Q: I have noticed that there is no more send email on the Handmade Hero website. Do you still reply to emails?"
    "1:29:24": "ltdemian Q: Where do you see the game development community going in the next 5-10 years?"
    "1:29:29": "iWumbo_ Q: What are the main differences in, for example, C and the language your friend is developing, in three sentences or less?"
    "1:29:38": "anonymous835 Q: Do you have experience with POSIX Linux system calls, fork() for example? I need to create a small Process Scheduler, but when I create a fork() inside a for cycle it messes up. I need to create N amount of processes, then save them to a FIFO list and start executing one at the time"
    "1:31:10": "Fyoucon Q: Would you want to be one of the first people to play around with JAI? Or would you wait 'till it gets more mature?"
    "1:32:37": "stelar7 Q: Are you going to check out OBS Studio this weekend?"
    "1:32:43": "ugurkodak Q: Do you work on another game project other than Handmade Hero?"

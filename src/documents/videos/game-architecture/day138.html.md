    "01:04:45": "You could try uninterleaving the channels in place like this: http://imgur.com/ZcDu4Tb"
    "01:05:50": "Probably the second-easiest way to deinterleave is multi-pass. Swap R0/L1, R2/L3, L4/L5 etc. Then do the same with two-sample blocks, four-sample blocks, etc. Easiest way is to deinterleave directly into mix/output buffer."
    "01:06:18": "Why do you need to un-interleave sound? When you play it, you still have to read both left and right values."
    "01:06:39": "People are asking about the benefits of extern C? What issues does it address?"
    "01:08:43": "Casey, can you please explain: (Chunk->Size + 1) & -1 ?"
    "01:14:16": "Why are the samples interleaved and not flat?"
    "01:15:15": "If you think of your interleaved data as an Nx2 matrix, then transposition can be viewed as interleaving. Here is an in-place way to do it: https://goo.gl/fgPmrg"
    "01:16:07": "Thank you."
    "01:18:05": "Why do you want to change the PCM data in place instead of compacting it to just the information you need and allocating extra space?"

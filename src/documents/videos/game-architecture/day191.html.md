    "1:01:04": "andsz_ Q: I think you added v3.xy for v3-to-v2 conversion"
    "1:01:46": "elxenoaizd Q: Even if the menus in the circle get cluttered, we could make it so that each button in the circle lead us to another circle / layer / subset of buttons"
    "1:02:17": "Sharlock93 Q: Can you explain a bit more on that closure stuff and how to do it in C? I didn't quite understand it"
    "1:07:57": "ijustwantfood Q: Why did you use radial menu over list or another format?"
    "1:08:24": "elxenoaizd Q: It would be cool if the menu items are aligned with the circle borders, that way there's less chance of the text colliding"
    "1:08:38": "elxenoaizd Q: You mentioned C doesn't officially support closures. Did you ever make an attempt to hack it, maybe via 'functors' or something like that?"
    "1:09:00": "ScorpionResponse Q: Have you ever considered a debug output for the stream where we can see your keystrokes?"
    "1:09:23": "Anticipate mr4thdimention's editor 4coder"
    "1:09:42": "elxenoaizd Q: Oftentimes when using somebody else's API / engine you end up having to 'fight' with it to have it do what you want from it. Do you think that is a sign that one should leave that API and try another / write his own instead of 'fighting' all the time?"
    "1:15:18": "powerc9k Q: Are you ready for the world to end tomorrow as predicted by crazy Christians?"
    "1:15:33": "Psi9 Q: Since draw rectangle quickly is in its own translation unit, are you going to write that code in straight ASM instead of C / intrinsics?"
    "1:15:50": "cubercaleb Q: Wait, isn't 4coder already better than Emacs?"
    "1:16:10": "cubercaleb Q: Can you go into detail on I/O Completion Ports since you brought them up?"
    "1:16:25": "Wind it down"

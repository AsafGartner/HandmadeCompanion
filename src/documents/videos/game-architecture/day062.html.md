    "1:01:01": "boondoggle42 Q: Owl of SHAME!!!"
    "1:01:40": "senjai Q: Do you ever use gdb?"
    "1:01:46": "senjai Q: Do you test more than just using asserts?"
    "1:01:57": "plainflavored Q: Why did you create a struct for each vector type, instead of using plain float arrays?"
    "1:04:24": "deepmist Q: Do you think version control would help when you go off on a tangent for the stream? You can roll back hacks like that?"
    "1:04:45": "ttbjm Q: Not a question but that hookshot thing actually looked like it would be kinda fun to play with"
    "1:05:11": "Reminder: Bendable shot which allows you to change direction of the shot once"
    "1:05:29": "plainflavored Q: What are your feelings on the vector multiply operator performing a dot product?"
    "1:06:37": "hanz_mantis Q: Do you keep your assertions for release code? If not, at what point do you remove them?"
    "1:07:00": "dsasilentsound Q: Why wouldn't you encapsulate each entity type into its separate classes?"
    "1:08:21": "tomforsyth Q: Correct, they use hadamard"
    "1:08:46": "mvargasmoran Q: Did you add the quick-calc hotkey?"
    "1:10:33": "vornayf Q: Is XML fair game in this project? It's not a library, but it still might not be handmade enough"
    "1:11:47": "xxxefwe Q: Don't you feel that Low entities have already too much extraneous stuff in them and it would be time soon to split them, and also things like the sword might not need the low part at all?"
    "1:13:50": "btngames Q: What will we do at 3PM PST when this game is finished?"
    "1:15:19": "celibdor Q: Are you happy with the current progress?"
    "1:15:59": "xxxefwe Q: More than memory footprint I was thinking about unwanted side effects, i.e. code that deals with the transfer of properties ends up triggering hard to debug shenanigans with the positioning etc."
    "1:17:13": "Wrap it up"

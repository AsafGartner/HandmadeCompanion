    "1:01:20": "robrobby Q: Is it useful when assets can be modified from outside (file on disk overwrite, maybe even in memory) and still work in-game? Is it now supported after an asset is loaded, as I could not see any callback to check if a file is modified, as your glazing speed refactoring was way too fast for me?"
    "1:02:50": "robotchocolatedino Q: In load_asset_work, where is the memory for the filenames stored?"
    "1:04:30": "robrobby Q: What are the trade-offs to give him more power forcing render pushes out of the rendering queue order?"
    "1:04:43": "abnercoimbre Q: You said we got asset streaming done in an hour, but do we need to do multiple passes on it? If so, why?"
    "1:06:04": "ttbjm Q: Where you check if an asset is already loaded or not, if an asset would take a very long time to load, would it check if it's loaded again to try to load the asset again? Not sure if that makes sense"
    "1:08:09": "emeseles Q: Do you consider terrain an asset too so that it can stream?"
    "1:08:32": "constantinopol Q: Why: \"if (Task) { work }\" versus \"if (!Task) return; work\"?"
    "1:09:39": "robrobby Q: What are the trade-offs to give him (the rendering queue) more power forcing render pushes out of the rendering queue order when it is multi-threaded so the rendering can be controlled more fine-tuned? You where thinking about that in the stream"
    "1:11:51": "emeseles Q: How much of the DirectX / OpenGL typical pipeline are you pre-emptively designing in to your code now?"
    "1:12:48": "emeseles Q: What do you think about Microsoft's _vectorcall as a calling convention for speed?"
    "1:15:04": "cubercaleb Q: Is it possible for the OS to lose track of memory that you ask for?"
    "1:15:59": "bkboggy Q: Could you elaborate on OpenGL and DirectX death?"
    "1:17:37": "coolsebz Q: What would be a good way to expand asset streaming to support increasing level of details? (What I'm thinking of is loading a smaller version of the asset first and then the bigger size resources)"
    "1:19:24": "dontrunaway2 Q: I recently started from the beginning of the series (on 13 atm). Do you suggest watching all of the Q&As or just going episode -> episode?"
    "1:20:38": "emeseles Q: How infuriating is it to deal with massive asset pipelines dealing with dozens of pieces of software on a large AAA project?"
    "1:22:48": "Call it a day"

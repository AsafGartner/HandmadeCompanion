    "00:58:24": "You said panning is just a function of volume, but could it also mix a portion of one source channel into the other output channel (for stereo)?"
    "01:03:08": "Earlier in the stream you were describing audio in relation to light and you mentioned how sound is volumetric. But isn't light also volumetric?"
    "01:12:08": "No special sound effects such as reverb?"
    "01:12:42": "Are you going to do any work with sound analysis or visualization using FFTs? Do have any experience with that kind of stuff?"
    "01:13:24": "Is their any need for an equalizer for the game's engine? I assume it would be trivial to implement."
    "01:14:54": "Won't we also want at least a low-pass filter for audio coming from, for example, the other side of a wall?"
    "01:15:50": "Some older sound cards could do cross-talk cancellation to try to do 3d sound with 2 or 4 speakers instead of with headphones, do you have any experience with this?"
    "01:16:07": "What is a good way to get sound to bounce off objects more realistically? (i.e., walls, cars, etc.)"

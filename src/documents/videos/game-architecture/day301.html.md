    "1:04:46": "andrewrussellnet Q: I have a question about your development approach: I don't think I've ever seen you create a separate program or environment to test stuff. You always seem to work within the running game. Do you ever find this \"noisy\"?"
    "1:10:17": "andrewrussellnet Q: I realise I tell a lie now. I have seen you do something along those lines on Witness Wednesdays, just less so on Handmade Hero"

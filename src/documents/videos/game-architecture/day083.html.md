    "1:36:07": "mr4thdimention Q: So if I understand correctly (sorry if my interpretation just confuses anyone), the reason off-screen rendering was incorrect before pre-multiplied alpha was that, after blending, things in the texture - the colours there - were pre-multiplied because they were multiplied when they were put in the texture. If, for some reason, you didn't want to optimise your code, you could also divide the colour channel by the alpha to get it back to un-pre-multiplied. Is this a reasonable understanding of the issue?"

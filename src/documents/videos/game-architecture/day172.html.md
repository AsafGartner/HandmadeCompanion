    "1:07:26": "ChronalDragon Q: Do you typically license fonts for use in games? Or does the loophole about rendering them to bitmaps mean you can just use whatever you want?"
    "1:07:48": "Recommend Google Fonts"
    "1:10:26": "abnercoimbre Q: Is fonts a topic you enjoy? An author once wrote: \"If music is the subjective application of physics, then font rasterisation is almost certainly the subjective application of computer science.\" Do you agree?"
    "1:11:10": "QuikliGames Q: Probably doesn't make sense to look at kerning for lowercase to Uppercase. I doubt many fonts bother with those cases"
    "1:12:05": "ijustwantfood Q: Would Times New Roman be any better?"
    "1:12:10": "JamesWidman Q: What are some examples of font / typesetting systems that can do kerning well? Is Knuth's TeX the only game in town?"
    "1:14:14": "bkboggy Q: Hmm... good point. More game designers should have a guy / gal who knows about fonts, because I see lots of games where it's hard to read quest text / chat text"
    "1:15:18": "abnercoimbre Q: Regarding the abstract text, I agree! Which is why I asked. Given your experience, maybe you could've read more into that than I could"
    "1:15:51": "Robrobby Q: The down-left corner of the \"A\" is cut, but you search bounds by the pixels, so why did this happen?"
    "1:16:33": "quartertron Q: Have you played Facade and / or met the designers?"
    "1:18:09": "Clear everything to black instead of white"
    "1:20:54": "Robrobby Q: You said Molly Rocket's upcoming game has crazy font functions - can you say one example what about fonts can be crazy? Just wondering"
    "1:21:12": "quartertron Q: What's behind the curtain?"
    "1:21:24": "garlandobloom Q: Facade was kinda interesting. One time I typoed the first thing I said to the guy when he opened the door and he just scowled, shut the door in my face and then the game faded to black and ended"

    "1:31:15": "snoringtortoise Q: Not sure if this has been answered on a previous stream (still trying to catch up). When you introduced the threading model, you mentioned that we would want one thread per core, but since the OS creates threads for us (so helpful) for things like audio, does it matter then that we end up with more threads than cores?"

    "1:04:19": "Would this be the time to put on screen text for debug info?"
    "1:05:15": "What is the variable called 'Gray'?"
    "1:05:55": "How does the difficulty of conceptualising this type of code compare to say coding the backend to a web application?"
    "1:07:03": "The window title bar is a nice place to spit out some text!"
    "1:07:37": "About replay buffers: I don't think we ever use the 0th buffer in the Win32State"
    "1:13:01": "When do you decide to add visual cues to help with debugging?"
    "1:14:28": "What are your thoughts on the progress you make daily?"
    "1:16:05": "Does the code actually handle skipping a tilemap?"
    "1:16:57": "Can the player go diagonally through two wall tiles joined by corners with the current collision detection code?"
    "1:18:19": "Why are you so fond of inline?"
    "1:20:38": "Are you going to have input envelopes for feel like acceleration and fricksion?"
    "1:21:04": "Can you explain what you meant by canonicalization in some simpler terms?"
    "1:26:11": "Would this kind of code be good for unit tests/fuzz tests to make sure strange corner cases don't creep around?"
    "1:27:10": "Are there reasons why programmers of older adventure games chose to move the character around the map and not vice versa?"
    "1:29:32": "Earlier you said const is ugly? Ugly because of how it looks or for some other reason?"
    "1:31:49": "What's your preferred 2D coordinate system? Y going up or down?"
    "1:32:48": "Now that there's no raw_position can we rename canonical_position to position and recanonicalize to fix or rebase?"
    "1:33:18": "Will we be using the tilemap for path finding or some other way to get smoother movement?"
    "1:33:51": "Will you release your version control system?"

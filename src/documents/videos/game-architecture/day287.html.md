    "1:04:16": "Miblo Q: I must have missed the bit about the snake. What is that?"
    "1:05:47": "nbm Q: It's actually a millipede"
    "1:06:10": "unrealdesign Q: How long do you hope this will go on for? Do you see yourself doing different game once this is finished?"
    "1:07:23": "lm4rcu5l Q: You mentioned you'd spend four hours cleaning code. Why not have a Handmade Hero day once every other month or so and deal with problems like that?"
    "1:07:43": "ezysigh Q: About the one entity per grid spot checking, how will you handle leaving a spot just before a monster lands there? Right now it's binary. Do you plan to add a fuzziness as you step off a square onto another one and a monster lands on your spot?"
    "1:09:53": "guitarm87 Q: Someday I will have to ask you about how to think when representing data in a program. I understand structs, enums, arrays and such. But what regulates when to use which?"
    "1:14:06": "longboolean Q: So the idea is to have the entity system both be able to support groups of entities that change from one into another (like a monster that mimics other objects), and entities that when separated from the group can take action on their own (like a necromancer resurrecting a ripped off arm)?"
    "1:15:45": "lachieds Q: Slightly off-topic: On average how many hours a day do you work on 1935?"
    "1:16:28": "paganheart Q: On the note of UML, how much / often would you say you deal with that at work, if at all? In the gamedev industry, anyway"
    "1:16:42": "guitarm87 Q: Good answer, I understand what you mean. Just do it enough and you'll see what works. Experience. Thanks!"
    "1:16:50": "elyasm Q: Have you thought about using Vulkan? It is super low-level access to hardware"

    "56:56": "desuused Q: Please use the following hash computation: HashValue = HashValue * 65599 + *Scan; (sdbm, source: http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html). Simply using a sum of chars *will* produce a lot of collisions. (source: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/145633 <-- not stackoverflow)"
    "1:00:47": "Pseudonym73 Q: Yes, the reasoning behind the hash is that it's used for symbols in ELF. If you think about it, symbols tend to come in clusters: i, j, k, x1, x2, x3 etc. ElfHash is designed to behave sensibly in that case"
    "1:03:29": "caffeine_storm Q: Do you have a stream schedule?"
    "1:04:26": "Pseudonym73 Q: Actually, could you humour me and look at the disassembly for that hash function? The 65599 one? I'm curious to know how well it compiles"
    "1:09:33": "Cubercaleb Q: what is imul, int multiply?"
    "1:16:18": "x13pixels Q: Dude, you inspired me to write a handmade Windows debugger. Thanks for everything you do"
    "1:16:46": "Mojobojo Q: Why did you put the delta time of each frame into the input struct (Input->dtForFrame). That seemed a bit strange to me while looking through the source code today"
    "1:17:13": "Cubercaleb Q: Why are the half-bytes of the hex value 1003fh reversed in the instruction. I could understand the bytes being reversed, but the half-bytes?"
    "1:20:41": "quartertron Q: And you want Intel to ship a unifying ISA for all GPUs..."
    "1:22:20": "x13pixels Q: I'll keep that in mind"
    "1:22:54": "Mojobojo Q: Why was it passed in that structure? It was specifically looking for the delta time variable and that was the last place I expected it to be"
    "1:24:13": "Mojobojo Q: To add on, since each player has their own input struct it seems to me like passing it through each one when its going to be the same for each player seems redundant"
    "1:25:39": "Wrap up. Thank you"

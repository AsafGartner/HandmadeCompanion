    "56:56": "desuused Q: Please use the following hash computation: HashValue = HashValue * 65599 + *Scan; (sdbm, source: http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html). Simply using a sum of chars *will* produce a lot of collisions. (source: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/145633)"
    "1:00:47": "Pseudonym73 Q: Yes, the reasoning behind the hash is that it's used for symbols in ELF. If you think about it, symbols tend to come in clusters: i, j, k, x1, x2, x3 etc. ElfHash is designed to behave sensibly in that case"
    "1:03:29": "caffeine_storm Q: Do you have a stream schedule?"
    "1:04:26": "Pseudonym73 Q: Actually, could you humour me and look at the disassembly for that hash function? The 65599 one? I'm curious to know how well it compiles"
    "1:09:33": "Cubercaleb Q: what is imul, int multiply?"
    "1:16:18": "x13pixels Q: Dude, you inspired me to write a handmade Windows debugger. Thanks for everything you do"
    "1:16:46": "Mojobojo Q: Why did you put the delta time of each frame into the input struct (Input->dtForFrame). That seemed a bit strange to me while looking through the source code today"
    "1:17:13": "Cubercaleb Q: Why are the half-bytes of the hex value 1003fh reversed in the instruction. I could understand the bytes being reversed, but the half-bytes?"
    "1:20:41": "quartertron Q: And you want Intel to ship a unifying ISA for all GPUs..."
    "1:22:20": "x13pixels Q: I'll keep that in mind"
    "1:22:54": "Mojobojo Q: Why was it passed in that structure? I was specifically looking for the delta time variable and that was the last place I expected it to be"
    "1:24:13": "Mojobojo Q: To add on, since each player has their own input struct, passing it through each one when it's going to be the same for each player seems redundant"
    "1:25:39": "Wrap up. Thank you"

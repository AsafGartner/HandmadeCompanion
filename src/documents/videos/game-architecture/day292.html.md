    "59:43": "badflydog Q: Wasn't today an off-day?"
    "1:00:09": "cubercaleb Q: Can the compiler really mess up the pointer arithmetic? I mean, it is just integer ops, can't be that hard to mess up"
    "1:02:28": "longboolean Q: So is the way to fix the snake from getting stuck to just allow it to run over itself or to make the snake AI smart enough to not trap itself?"
    "1:03:48": "busy_beaver Q: I've recently watched your video on the GJK algorithm, it's great, thanks for that! Did you also do a video on the EPA algorithm? [see Resources]"
    "1:04:02": "sir_kane Q: Will the snake head be able to move to the position of its last segment? So it can go in a circle / loop"
    "1:04:50": "sssmcgrath Q: WTF you did a video on GJK? What other explanation videos have you done?"
    "1:05:09": "paradjanin Q: Are you going to implement every AI thing in brain entity? When does path-finding and rest of AI coming on schedule? Also can you say some good reference book for AI? Cheers, Casey"
    "1:06:47": "sssmcgrath Q: Yeah, and IMGUI, but what else? [see Resources]"
    "1:07:18": "busy_beaver Q: Expanding Polytope Algorithm"
    "1:09:09": "longboolean Q: Could you briefly explain how a snake segment knows which node to jump to? A non head segment, that is"
    "1:09:25": "cubercaleb Q: Don't forget the API video! [see Resources]"
    "1:11:10": "busy_beaver Q: Well I've got GJK + EPA implemented in 2D and GJK in 3D, but I am a bit struggling at EPA in 3D"
    "1:12:23": "Wrap it up"

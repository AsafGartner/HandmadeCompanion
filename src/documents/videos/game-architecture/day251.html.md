Like, in your first grid example, how does it know not to draw a triangle from your center vertex to the upper left vertex (or any opposing vertex, for that matter)?"

    "1:20:37": "ffsjs Q: For people who do 3D meshes, it seems there's a rule (at least for Blender, as far as I know) that using anything else than quads for topology produces rendering artifacts, so it has to be avoided. Is this because when rendering in-game everything gets split again into triangles? Ignore the Q: if what I'm asking doesn't make sense"

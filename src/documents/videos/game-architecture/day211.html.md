    "1:06:59": "culver_fly Q: Just asking, but is it worthwhile to put so much effort on the debug system at this stage? There's a lot of things you're doing right now that I'm not sure how it will help in the future (maybe just because I have never programmed games before), but if I as a newbie game programmer were to work on this, do you suggest going as far as you're going right now or proceed on the gaming part to see what I need first before doing it?"

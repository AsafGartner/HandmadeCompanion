    "18:43": "Brief interlude: See how big those Chunks are"

    "40:27": "DrawRectangle does not take a Width and a Height"
    "41:26": "...and the Y needs flipping"
    "42:11": "We're getting there, but the Chunks are drawn too tiny"
    "42:46": "Assess the size of the Chunks"
    "43:08": "Try making a Chunk a quarter the size"
    "44:10": "Set the Chunk size based on the size of a 256*256 block"

    "55:39": "Do CameraBounds a little differently"
    "56:05": "Introduce SimBounds based on the CameraBounds"

    "1:07:01": "This was working totally perfectly"
    "1:07:53": "Problem solved"
    "1:08:41": "Q&A"
    "1:09:27": "Q: What is Muratori syntax?"
    "1:10:32": "Q: Will the random ground splats be based on some seed so that the ground buffer can be regenerated the same as it was after it gets evicted?"
    "1:11:13": "Q: I'm sure it's been asked a bunch, but any tips for what language to start with and how to start?"
    "1:12:56": "Someone found a Muratori 'for' statement in the wild"
    "1:14:35": "Q: Why are you not passing World as an address when calling functions?"
    "1:15:01": "Q: Are you going to implement Z-buffers and texture scaling?"
    "1:16:08": "Q: Is there any other possibility for a Z-buffer?"
    "1:19:11": "miblo Q: Couldn't you set the SimBounds expansion from the screen dimensions or CameraBoundsInMeters or something? Hope I'm understanding it correctly"
    "1:20:30": "Q: Will you be implementing dynamic lighting or any deferred rendering for lots of real lights, etc?"
    "1:22:45": "Q: Is there anyone you can suggest for a hardcore render guy?"
    "1:23:40": "Closing remarks"

    "1:11:20": "mmozeiko Q: gcc & clang don't have m128_f32 member for __m128. They need _mm_store_ps or something like ((float*)&A->P.x)[index] (or union with float array)"
    "1:12:05": "handmade_particles.cpp: Use the M macro for rendering the particles and introduce handmade_simd.h"
    "1:16:04": "nxsy Q: soysaucethekid was suggesting to slow down the time to make sure it is now right"
    "1:19:52": "thesizik Q: Not too long ago, you changed world coordinates to be s32 instead of u32. I think they were unsigned originally so that overflow would work correctly to have the world wrap around"
    "1:20:27": "cyberpunkhobo Q: Does the Z position of the particles not get affected by the perspective transform?"
    "1:22:58": "thesizik Q: But when your position goes from INT_MIN to INT_MAX, won't it cause undefined behavior?"
    "1:23:49": "todo.txt: Update the TODO list"
    "1:24:16": "thesizik Q: Signed integer overflow?"
    "1:25:45": "Lament the absence of real 3D and close things down"

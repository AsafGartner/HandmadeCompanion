    "1:02:29": "Q: Could you give us examples of what some of the simpler things will be in the render_group?"
    "1:02:47": "Q: Are there any static code analysis tools for C / Visual Studio that will help pick up bugs like unused variables, etc?"
    "1:04:38": "d7samurai Q: So are you planning on abstracting away the renderer as a layer, similar to how we separated the platform from the game code, so that the various renderers will be operating on the same data structures?"
    "1:05:48": "Q: If you were going to write an algorithm to generate Sudoku puzzles, how would it work?"
    "1:06:03": "Q: Unused variables are a warning on my compiler. Did you turn that warning off? I use an allow local macro when I want it to ignore the variable"
    "1:06:56": "Q: Would it make sense for the render_group to contain render groups itself?"
    "1:07:44": "d7samurai Q: I meant whether you plan for the data describing what needs to be rendered to be in a format such that it's suitable for both software and hardware rendering"
    "1:08:45": "Q: Will our hero always be taller than the treetops?"

I've done all sorts of debug systems, not much like what you're doing now, and I'm curious what other stuff you may have done (just high level description, one-sentence descriptions are fine). Thanks!"

    "1:13:48": "elxenoaizd Q: I was implementing Shadow mapping in OpenGL. It seems that there's a lot of issues and artifacts: Shadow Acne, Peter Panning etc., and to work around those you end up with something more complex and expensive. I kind of find it hard to believe that games with decent graphics use this technique. Do you know of any other good way to implement shadows, or do we just have to work around its limitations?"

## Quotes

* 299\. So you can be, like, GetEventFromLink or something. And I don't mean Link like the character in Legend of Zelda (22:51)
* 300\. So riddle me this, Batman... (31:35)
* 301\. But if you ship a hardware platform that you don't allow people to program for, due to your avarice and greed or whatever it is, then I'm sorry, there are no defences for it. And then we're going to grind you up for sausage, to feed hungry people (1:26:10)

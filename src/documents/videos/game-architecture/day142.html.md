    "00:53:49": "constantinopol Q: Can you show again how you skipped a failed assertion, by going to disassembly?"
    "01:00:10": "swampy_butt Q: Would there be any case where you would like to increase volume non-linearly?"
    "01:02:01": "flyingsand Q: So far you can just change the volume of individual sounds. Should we be able to change the volume of the master output as well?"
    "01:03:26": "chronaldragon Q: Will Handmade Hero support spatialization? e.g. sound mostly in left channel if on left side of the screen, sound mostly in right channel if on right side, etc."
    "01:04:03": "rpg_ignis Q: How hard would it be to do a fade-out/fade-in for the music when the window loses focus/gets focus back?"
    "01:05:09": "gasto5 Q: So what did you end up doing to dVolume if it wasn't linear interpolation?"
    "01:05:28": "waterlimon Q: If you implemented Assert using ?: instead of if, you could use it as part of expressions or other such places where you can't have an if statement"
    "01:06:15": "gasto5 Q: Did you already implement audio clipping?"
    "01:07:34": "gasto5 Q: (clarification) Managing audio dynamic range. Yes"
    "01:08:04": "waterlimon Q: With respect to Assert, I don't know why you would want to put one in an expression, but apparently that's how it's usually implemented... It can't hurt, right?"
    "01:09:45": "flyingsand Q: You can't just hard-clip audio, though. If you don't use a compressor/limiter you would have to at least use soft-clipping with tanh or something"
    "01:10:12": "gasto5 Q: Will you implement audio file compression?"
    "01:11:35": "abnercoimbre Q: What would an audio compressor do?"
    "01:13:45": "gasto5 Q: How much optimization would the mixer require?"
    "01:14:21": "javajax Q: What is the difference between a limiter and a compressor?"

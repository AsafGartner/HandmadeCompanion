    "43:53": "Can you change the whiteboard colors?"
    "46:33": "Do you plan on getting into calculus to get better collision detection?"
    "47:05": "Do you think any need to prototype some features in some other language?"
    "47:43": "If we changed the resolution of the game, would it change the size of the objects?"
    "48:25": "Can you do collision detection based on if a bitmap and a pixel has alpha?"
    "51:15": "Is it interesting to have a tutorial on floating-point computations?"
    "52:05": "Why not use the old collision system and use the new one only if it finds a collision?"
    "53:03": "What about the tiles? Will they stay the same if you change resolution?"
    "54:53": "What is dynamic loading? I thought C code has to be compiled."

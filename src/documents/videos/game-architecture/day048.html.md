    "51:15": "Is it interesting to have a tutorial on floating-point computations?"
    "52:05": "Why not use the old collision system and use the new one only if it finds a collision?"
    "53:03": "What about the tiles? Will they stay the same if you change resolution?"
    "54:53": "What is dynamic loading? I thought C code has to be compiled."

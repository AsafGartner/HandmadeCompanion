    "58:33": "Q&A"
    "59:18": "abnercoimbre Q: I'm guessing the engine will manage arbitrarily high ground levels? Would you really want that? Gameplay such as projecting attacks to a monstar below does sound fun"
    "1:00:48": "programgamer Q: Why not use the X and Y positions as they appear on the screen for detecting sim regions?"
    "1:01:18": "marco_castorina Q: Should you also check the \"stair step\" at the top of the top of the stairs? It seems you can exit earlier than at the bottom"
    "1:03:01": "jarsefax Q: Could you please do an overview, on blackboard maybe, of the \"entities position system\" (world, screen, etc.) now that it's \"done\"? I'm having trouble understanding it (hopefully you'll understand my question)"
    "1:06:39": "kknewkles Q: Why is the order of stuff drawn on the screen janky (some trees overlap others, some are proper)?"
    "1:06:46": "kknewkles Q: Isn't it easy to draw them in order - each layer draws entities left to right, top to bottom?"
    "1:08:09": "ikerms Q: Is the reason why things in different levels seem shifted up due to the Z-offset when rendering?"
    "1:09:15": "ikerms Q: Will this cause for the wall on the top to be drawn above the screen when the camera is locked instead of following the character?"
    "1:09:52": "acrmuui Q: When you are allocating everything with custom memory allocators, do you only use the stack for pointers?"
    "1:10:25": "programgamer Q: Are you not worried that three dimensions might complicate entity A.I. to the point where it impacts performance?"
    "1:11:21": "pjh777 Q: Casey, can you check your forum registration process? I never got a confirmation email - registered a couple of days ago"
    "1:12:23": "rooctag Q: When will you switch back to centered camera? It seems to be missing on the TODO list"
    "1:12:44": "cvaucher Q: Any particular reason behind making the chunk origin the center of the chunk rather than one of the corners?"
    "1:13:47": "acrmuui Q: Sorry for being unclear. Do you store anything else than pointers on the stack?"
    "1:14:34": "programgamer Q: If the camera were far away enough from the player, would the player go into a simpler routine like the rest of the entities?"
    "1:14:56": "rooctag Q: Should the possible collision test use the TestHitEntity instead of the TestEntity or are they the same? Can you briefly go over the flow of the HitEntity changes?"
    "1:21:30": "rooctag Q: You could now cancel out the first HitThis == true and not do other checks"
    "1:23:06": "We have agreed to go on break for a week"

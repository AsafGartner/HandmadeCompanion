    "1:06:12": "kknewkles Q: Kind of didn't get it from the email - are you still up to putting a break sometime soon and make a little intro series to programming?"
    "1:07:18": "dr_s80 Q: Another use case to consider for the Y- / Z-sorting: \"flat\" things laying on top of other \"flat\" things (like a rug on a floor). How would the Y-sort position be set in this case, especially if the thing on top was larger than the thing(s) it was laying on?"
    "1:09:03": "kknewkles Q: You wanted to go a bit more serious than Intro to C early on. Maybe you changed your mind since"
    "1:09:18": "garryjohanson Q: What do you think of representing entities as 3D objects to keep things simple? Like cylinders for characters, and cubes for tiles and rooms?"

    "1:14:44": "Blackboard: Considering this in 3D"
    "1:17:13": "acoto87 Q: Maybe you need to sort the objects separately in both Y and Z and then solve the conflicts if an object A is before object B in the Y-sort and in reverse order in the Z-sort?"
    "1:20:28": "Close down, to be continued..."

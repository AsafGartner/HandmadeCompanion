    "55:07": "Q&A"
    "55:31": "fr0styninja Q: Do you think like a sort of rhythmic based movement where the hero would have to wait a bit before being able to move again (say he's getting ready for a jump instead of stamina-lessly jumping around non-stop) could perhaps help in this situation? Realise it's a design decision and might not be what you're looking for, but perhaps you haven't entertained the idea"
    "56:21": "ttbjm Q: Do you think rotating the torso would help?"
    "57:12": "cubercaleb Q: For the Q&A can you have the hero walk around on a live loop?"
    "57:44": "sssmcgrath Q: Try wrapping the body around bezier rather than just linear stretching?"
    "58:24": "billdstrong Q: For the up-down motion, couldn't you forgo the stretch, and have a jump of each part?"
    "58:38": "beerchug Q: Why wouldn't you shear the top of the feet to stay under the moving body?"
    "59:11": "commandercool0 Q: What about a small translation of the body before and after the jump, say 10%-20% of the distance between adjacent dots?"
    "59:52": "handmade_world_mode.cpp: Displace the body based on the distance of the head from the nearest traversable point"
    "1:05:06": "Run the game and check out the displacement"
    "1:05:35": "handmade_world_mode.cpp: Apply the floor displacement only to the cape"
    "1:05:56": "Run the game and check out the cape's displacement"
    "1:06:35": "btngames Q: The more I see the more I like this. I wonder whether a subtle head bob may add a feeling of believability. Just a thought"
    "1:07:47": "longboolean Q: Would it help if the body stayed on the tile, but the cape was positioned between the body and the head?"
    "1:08:21": "Consider asking Yangtian for art that is more top-down"
    "1:09:48": "thesizik Q: Perhaps a minimum stretch length so you don't get disappearing bitmaps while moving down?"
    "1:10:03": "Close up"

    "1:10:45": "Have you already decided what PRNG algorithm you're going to use?"
    "1:11:02": "As you put the tile map in 3D dimensions, could this be related to a voxel octtree algorithm?"
    "1:14:18": "Is there a reason for the chunk size to be a power of 2?"
    "1:16:34": "When do you use #define instead of local variables?"
    "1:19:12": "Why are you using inline in variables?"
    "1:19:30": "Why not use bit flags for floors and such?"
    "1:20:14": "Why would you prefer an array of tile chunks?"
    "1:24:30": "Are you following Robert C. Martin Rules?"
    "1:24:40": "Are we planning to load/unload tile chunks on demand?"
    "1:25:40": "How much of this code will be used in the final procedural generation?"
    "1:26:26": "Are we planning on making the tile map layered?"
    "1:27:02": "Microphone question."
    "1:27:15": "Why suffix types with 32 such as bool32?"
    "1:28:35": "Will we need compression for basic sparse tilemap storage?"
    "1:29:18": "How computationally expensive is the sparse storage?"
    "1:33:12": "Should rooms only be created when the player is close to them?"
    "1:39:01": "Are you worried about memory leaks?"
    "1:39:31": "Are ternaries bad?"
    "1:40:02": "Why is not possible to save the full map?"

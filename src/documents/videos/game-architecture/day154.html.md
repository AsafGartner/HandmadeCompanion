    "00:04:03": "Getting rid of hardcoded file names"
    "00:05:22": "Listing file names on Windows (FindFirstFile)"
    "00:08:55": "The lpFileName parameter can include wildcards"
    "00:10:54": "Listing the rest of the files (FindNextFile)"

    "00:13:48": "Invoking FindClose on the file handle returned by FindFirstFile"
    "00:15:10": "Structuring the file loop to be more uniform"
    "00:16:30": "(aside) Textbook horrible API design"
    "00:19:29": "Problem: we don't know how many files there are until we have looped over them"
    "00:20:33": "Revising the file API. There's no need for random access of files. Sequential access is enough and is cleaner to implement"
    "00:21:28": "Preiterating the files"
    "00:22:31": "Allocating space for the win32 opaque data segment of the platform_file_group struct"
    "00:23:32": "Discussion on extensible platform non-specific types. This type of \"space saving for dynamic unions\" can be implemented using C++ inheritance, but we will encounter other types that can't"
    "00:26:31": "Freeing the platform_file_group"
    "00:31:07": "Second iteration to load the files, now that we know how many of them there are"

    "00:38:12": "Choosing the ANSI versions of system calls and structures"
    "00:40:54": "Getting the file names"
    "00:41:08": "Testing the code so far"

    "00:48:37": "Possible extensions to the file API"
    "00:50:07": "Q&A"
    "00:51:15": "Does the save file need to use this system now?"
    "00:52:29": "How do you feel now that you finished this?"
    "00:53:27": "Socapex insists that the STL *is* the language and that you therefore should use \"strings\" from it"
    "00:56:32": "Could you elaborate on the union style inheritance you mentioned? In the same vein, will entities end up being unions?"
    "00:59:26": "What about updating the asset file with more files? How do you manage a ton assets as in knowing what is where?"
    "01:00:09": "Will the ASCII version of FindFirstFile work even if the full file path has unicode in it?"
    "01:01:20": "Will pre-rendered fonts be included into the HHA file?"
    "01:01:26": "Is this the new Call of Duty?"
    "01:02:46": "Does the requirement to call FileClose() make more sense when you consider that FindFirstChangeNotification/FindNextChangeNotification/RefreshDirectory are part of the same API?"
    "01:05:02": "How are you doing the audio?"
    "01:05:50": "You wrote code for \"Lineage Forever\"? Any comment on writing it on the game/any other Lineage games? Lineage 1 pretty much sparked my entire career as a computer scientist/programmer"
    "01:08:42": "What's after the asset file loading?"
    "01:08:58": "Why do you use #defines for things like PLATFORM_GET_ALL_FILE_OF_TYPE_BEGIN instead of just normal function call?"
    "01:10:03": "I have not followed the latest episodes due to I actually watching it from the beginning. But is there any like crypting in savefiles regarding cheating, etc?"
    "01:11:32": "Are there any books on game programming or general programming that you would recommend?"
    "01:13:53": "What do you think about \"Game Engine Architecture\" by J. Gregory ? The books looks solid"
    "01:14:10": "(Referring back to Q at 00:59:26) I meant the artist is making files how do you track what you added and what you didn't. What assets have changed. and need updated kind of thing?"
    "01:15:42": "Is the graphics double-buffered?"
    "01:17:05": "When are you going to stream your hands coding? Would be neat. You talked about doing it some time"
    "01:17:37": "(Referring back to Q at 01:10:03) Well just because people would know how to beat the encryption, doesn't mean it would be a bad thing to teach in this series"
    "01:18:52": "Have you read \"The Tao of Programming?\""
    "01:18:59": "Does it tear with Aero disabled?"

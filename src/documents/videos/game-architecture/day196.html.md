    NOTE(annotator): These are the notes I dropped into the chat during the
    stream, with the times in UTC

    00:12:50: Day 196 Start
    00:15:53: EOT - Intro
    00:17:29: EOT - Set the stage for the day
    00:22:25: EOT - Blackboard: UI Input Processing
    00:25:22: EOT - handmade_debug.cpp: Explain how the code is structured for IMGUI
    00:28:17: EOT - handmade_debug.h: Introduce *Hot, *InteractingWith and *NextHot debug_variables
    00:34:54: EOT - handmade_debug.cpp: Build up DEBUGInteract using those variables
    00:35:16: EOT - Run the game and see what happens
    00:37:10: EOT - handmade_debug.cpp: Determine whether the variable we're interacting with is Hot
    00:42:32: EOT - handmade_debug.cpp: Introduce DEBUGBeginInteract and DEBUGEndInteract
    00:45:32: EOT - handmade_debug.cpp: Implement the ability to click and drag
    00:45:44: EOT - Run the game
    00:47:32: EOT - Do something
    00:49:17: EOT - Run the game and note an interesting situation regarding the interaction
    00:50:49: EOT - handmade_debug.h: Introduce debug_interaction
    00:58:09: EOT - handmade_debug.cpp: Test the interaction state in order to determine which type of interaction to perform
    00:59:01: EOT - Run the game and check out our new ability
    01:00:19: EOT - handmade_debug.h: Add NOP to debug_interaction
    01:00:47: EOT - Run the game and try out this new NOP interaction type
    01:04:35: EOT - handmade_debug.h: Introduce debug_variable_hierarchy
    01:04:54: That last annotation is way off, by the way...
    01:06:25: EOT - handmade_debug.cpp: Setup the hierarchy
    01:08:54: EOT - Debugger: Step in
    01:09:04: EOT - Run the game and find it's all working

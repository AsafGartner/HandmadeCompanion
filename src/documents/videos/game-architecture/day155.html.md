    "01:01:34": "naysayer88 Q: For a while I have felt that interpolating particles in RGB leads to results that are dull and muddy. I have been wanting to try YCrCb or maybe even LAB sometime. I guess you can compensate via splines through RGB but I think you'd be doing a lot of tweaky work all the time to get better results (even though YCrCb is just a linear transformation, I think there's a substantial amount of skew.)"
    "01:03:09": "rohit_n Q: Will particle pre-warming be supported?"
    "01:04:23": "effect0r Q: When you were messing with the z direction, it seems kind of like a puddle on the ground"
    "01:04:35": "garryjohanson Q: Ever messed with using some kind of a stateless system of doing this? Like one function parameterized by another function?"
    "01:05:05": "noxy_key Q: Is rain a particle system?"
    "01:05:13": "jameswidman Q: I wonder if head particles like this could be used in the game... for example as an effect of magic related to disguises. Like, when you dissolve the disguise of the Superfish"
    "01:05:32": "naysayer88 Q: Witness is RGB and probably too late to change, but we don't rely on wowee particles much"
    "01:06:29": "thesizik Q: Z still points towards the screen"
    "01:07:02": "kknewkles Q: Does anyone ever use layers? Or just Z-sorting?"
    "01:07:18": "smellyapples1 Q: At what time does Handmade Hero stream? I saw this on the front page and it seems interesting"
    "01:07:57": "naysayer88 Q: Maybe for the Galaga game I will switch to HSV..."
    "01:08:30": "devilinar Q: Will these videos help someone learn C and C++ who has absolutely no experience?"
    "01:10:36": "hitmanatee Q: Have you, or will you explain how shaders work?"
    "01:11:04": "ingenero Q: Will these particles be able to react to things like impacts?"
    "01:11:44": "kknewkles Q: How many particles at the moment?"
    "01:11:58": "kknewkles Q: How many particles till we see a noticeable slowdown?"
    "01:14:00": "shreddersherlock Q: Are you using Emacs outside of Visual Studio or inside of it?"
    "01:14:10": "an0nymal Q: When do you plan on implementing a way to adjust the position of the individual particles when the entities move?"
    "01:15:02": "cortexoverride Q: What made you pick C++ over C#?"
    "01:15:55": "breadthofhair Q: What parameters will you tweak with curves? Scale, position, color, rotation, external forces, etc. Will the curves depend on time only?"
    "01:17:16": "mruno_bars Q: How many times have you said \"right\" in this broadcast?"
    "01:17:50": "kknewkles Q: Is your .emacs config open source?"
    "01:18:05": "childz Q: Can you explain what procedural level generation is? Are there other types of generation, and if so what are the differences?"
    "01:18:54": "garryjohanson Q: What do you think about using Unity as a platform layer and using all your own logic?"
    "01:19:57": "kknewkles Q: Why do you pronounce \"nightmare\" as \"night mirror\"?"
    "01:20:07": "caiustsm Q: Do you have someone making the game assets for you or are they self made?"
    "01:20:17": "hitmanatee Q: Will you be making development tools for Handmade hero, like a map editor?"
    "01:20:33": "kknewkles Q: (Referring to Q at 1:17:50) I mean is your config *public domain*? Can I give it to someone who'd like to get started with Emacs? I myself preordered ages ago, best 15$ expenditure of my life. NO CONTEST. <3"
    "01:20:56": "garryjohanson Q: (Referring to Q at 1:18:54) You can use DLLs. I have done this!! Much using rust, fyi"
    "01:21:55": "kknewkles Q: You went from two-k on my name to zero-k. A single one would be appreciated ;D"
    "01:22:32": "henco7 Q: I mean the particular flow or direction is now from bottom up. Feels like its not hard to do left to right for example"
    "01:24:02": "d7samurai Q: I think it's like GNOOKLES, but with a K sound instead of G"

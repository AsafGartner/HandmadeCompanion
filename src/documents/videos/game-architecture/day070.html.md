    "56:42": "Q&A"
    "57:22": "Isn't doing this list thinking too far ahead or thinking too far according to your compression-oriented programming?"
    "59:15": "In the GetHashFromStorageIndex function, you do some bit-twiddling to map hash value into hash index.  Is there a reason that you didn't just compute hash index as hash index = hash value MOD array count?"
    "1:03:19": "Right now the familiar lags behind since it moves slower than the player.  There may be many legitimate situations where the player and familiar may be separated.  Have you considered implementing a proportional integral derivative controller for its speed?"
    "1:04:44": "Could you briefly go over the solution for the collision table again?"
    "1:04:56": "Do we have to do z-sorting?  For a game like this, can't we just sort on the y-axis, and do things to simulate climbing stairs (change the velocity as the character moves up something like stairs and what have you)?"
    "1:06:28": "I heard you talking about animations and see you wrote down a skeletal system.  Do you have plans on importing from a pre-made program or making an animation program for the artist to use?"
    "1:07:57": "For the list - Superfish!"
    "1:08:55": "Asset loading management is missing from the list."
    "1:09:40": "What 2D game can you think of that did good z-movement?  I personally always liked Prince of Persia when he climbed the steps at the end of the level."
    "1:10:32": "Have you seen watchpeoplecode.com?"
    "1:11:20": "What is your opinion on using existing code someone else wrote as a learning tool?"
    "1:12:58": "Spriter's file format is completely open and documented."
    "1:13:24": "Do you want to have quests in the game?  In this case, how are you planning to define them?"
    "1:14:08": "I think we dropped the check for Entity == HitEntity in collision code last time, or did I miss something?"
    "1:15:03": "Will you patent the monstar pathfinding algorithm?"
    "1:16:02": "For z-axis movement, would it be feasible to resize the sprite to be larger as they move up, and then resize the sprite to be smaller once it reaches the level, while doing some parallax stuff on the wall textures for the second resize?"
    "1:17:58": "I think Pokemon 3rd gen/1st gen did good stuff with the z-axis."
    "1:18:35": "Will the monstar encounters be random based (like Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior) or will they be more static (Zelda style)?"
    "1:19:10": "Should there be a time limit as well as a distance limit on the sword?"
    "1:20:09": "Minish Cap handles the z-axis really well."
    "1:20:16": "How exactly does your question sorting plugin work?"
    "1:20:33": "I believe Ultima Online did some stuff with z-axis, but I'm not sure if it's good though."
    "1:21:13": "What's the biggest game project you personally worked on?"
    "1:22:14": "No remark on handmade animations?  Or did I miss that?"
    "1:23:21": "I've been writing my own platform layer in my own code, and I've found I've been 'poisoned' by your approach.  By this, I've been heading down by a path very similar to yours simply through knowledge of a possible solution to it.  This leads me to a very narrow way of thinking about problems.  Do you run into this as well?  How do you break through the wall?  It takes me a very long to get solutions that fit my needs when I see someone else's."
    "1:28:38": "How long do you think a good game should be?"

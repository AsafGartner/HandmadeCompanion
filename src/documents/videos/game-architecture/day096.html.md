    "1:14:16": "theottergod Q: Why don't we just have the lighting feigned on the sprites?"
    "1:15:16": "flaturated Q: How about the second framebuffer you mentioned with light sources having precomputed distance falloff, plus graphics objects having another channel similar to alpha that indicates reflectivity? That would be fast and maybe good enough for a 2D game"
    "1:15:51": "Blackboard: Illumination is constant along a line"
    "1:18:34": "johanso Q: Due to the complexity of lighting, are system resources a major factor/consideration in shading engines?"
    "1:19:10": "grumpygiant256 Q: If you use a 2D lighting buffer, will you need to generate a G-buffer or Z-buffer as well first?"
    "1:19:47": "chokeagun Q: What about bleeding effects?"
    "1:19:55": "insofaras Q: Is this going to work with software rendering or will it be too computationally expensive?"
    "1:20:37": "erdomina Q: You mentioned computing values for a single source receiving light from multiple sources. How would we in essence do this computation? I'm assuming it's based off of neighbouring pixel values. I'm having a hard time formulating an approach"
    "1:22:09": "sv3ns0nic Q: Wouldn't it (in most cases) be smarter to use an existing graphic / render engine and just focus on coding the game itself / gameplay?"
    "1:25:03": "runningmyself Q: What is the ambient occlusion and why my video card get late to run games with ambient occlusion? Like really lose FPS"

    "1:31:47": "tsongbird Q: Do you prefer cake or muffins?"
    "1:31:59": "n2__ Q: Do you have any plans to implement sprite opacity and, if so, could it be taken into consideration with the light map calculation, i.e. less opaque objects block less light?"
    "1:32:40": "naddafadda Q: Are there any books or resources you would recommend on lighting or game engine creation in general?"
    "1:33:51": "tweester Q: So game design documentation, like a roadmap for the game?"
    "1:34:27": "morwakawaka Q: Wouldn't a game in pitch darkness have the easiest lighting system to code?"
    "1:35:19": "redfin9 Q: Can you go back in time and start this series 15 years ago?"
    "1:35:52": "tsongbird Q: If you did choose cake, would it be a cheese or mud cake?"
    "1:36:05": "mmair0ne Q: What I mean is sort of more like how to make beams of light pass through a rendered object"
    "1:36:24": "Blackboard: God rays"
    "1:41:48": "twinduoq Q: Don't you cast rays from the eye and not the sun to reduce calculations, and then see if the rays cast from the eye hit the sun?"
    "1:43:26": "darthkoonstyle Q: Can you use a 3D overlay to pretend, say, a slice of a 3D environment. For example, the platform you are on being z, and then x is across, y up and down. So you can have a light source at x 33, y 50, z 1. So all objects less than x 33 would be shadowed to the right, objects greater than would be shadowed to the left, greater than y 50 would be brighter to the front and less would be shadowed to the back... I don't know if this is making sense, but would it be possible?"
    "1:44:13": "cubercaleb Q: In early episodes you worked on having multiple z levels. Wouldn't this mean you would need to render walls in 3D, thus introducing some 3D into the rendering and lighting calculations?"
    "1:44:42": "itisbob Q: How often do you stream Game Development?"
    "1:45:12": "redfin9 Q: What is your background that led to where you are? Is education important or interest more important?"
    "1:45:26": "morwakawaka Q: Will this lighting system work for blind people?"
    "1:45:49": "deadvertex Q: Do you think we'll be able to do all this in real time or will we have to pre-bake some of the lighting information when generating the map?"
    "1:46:11": "morwakawaka Q: Couldn't you just make a 3D game and then flatten it with a rolling pin?"
    "1:46:29": "irdumbs Q: How often is real time radiosity used in games? Is it easy, and do you guys use it? Why or why not? Any hints?"
    "1:48:06": "dgmtv Q: I saw a game that uses normal maps on sprites"
    "1:48:39": "yakra13 Q: Isn't lights falloff inverse square? As you move farther from the source each ray is further from its neighbors"
    "1:48:55": "Blackboard: Inverse square law"
    "1:51:36": "grumpygiant256 Q: Would you consider voxelizing the scene like Little Big Planet 2 does?"
    "1:52:46": "oliholli Q: Had to log in so hopefully this isn't too late. Wouldn't there be falloff with a point source when integrating across the surface, since the rays spread out away from the source?"
    "1:54:33": "ice_engine Q: Why is it easier to represent light as photons and not particles in 3D programs?"
    "1:55:08": "irdumbs Q: Rendering light in environments and events approaching the speed of light. How to do it?"
    "1:55:24": "doctoromega Q: PBR lightning? Quick run down on how it works?"
    "1:55:41": "We have come to the end"

    "56:42": "How will collision be done with moving backgrounds?  Such as mazes and moving tiles?  Or that won't be in this game?"
    "59:36": "Why don't we use .c instead of .cpp?"
    "1:00:03": "When you started with enums, why did you start with (1 << 1) instead of (1 << 0?)"
    "1:00:26": "How big are the source files getting?  Are you feeling overwhelmed by the size yet?"
    "1:01:55": "What happens when you somehow glitch through a wall?  Will the game crash?"
    "1:02:47": "How many lines have you written so far?"
    "1:03:12": "In what situation would you prefer callbacks to a huge switch-case block?"
    "1:07:40": "Do we load and draw everything manually to a DIB section, then blit the final image?"
    "1:08:15": "After you mentioned the 'do all collisions at one time' thing, it seems like in addition to being greatly easier to implement, it also matches the real-world better, like summing all the forces to get the net direction.  Why would anyone every want to do an update function for each object?"
    "1:09:42": "I [Jonathan Blow] use cloc to count lines.  It is pretty decent."
    "1:12:06": "Besides the bits that are obviously tacked on, would you consider the Windows GUI a good API?"
    "1:13:40": "I guess I should have asked how big it has to get for you to start feeling overwhelmed."
    "1:14:29": "How'd you decide on this order to build up the engine?  Was it intuition or experience?"
    "1:19:09": "Speaking of UML and diagrams, do you ever use class schematics for code planning?"
    "1:19:42": "Don't you need to be able to enumerate every possibility in order to use a switch statement?  What if you wanted to make a system that can be extended?"
    "1:21:33": "Why use switch statements instead of just big if-else blocks?"
    "1:21:54": "Will the way in which collisions are handled be order-independent?"
    "1:22:56": "Is it better to debug as you go or towards the end of a programming cycle?"
    "1:25:05": "Actually you want to pass --no3, otherwise it [cloc] is lying about the number of lines - it is dumb."
    "1:26:39": "Will the game have multiplayer and/or co-op?"

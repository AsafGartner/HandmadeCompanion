    "1:11:26": "apathydude Q: Have you thought more on how the Z-axis will look when finally implemented?"
    "1:12:35": "biralx Q: When you work on a game do you work on one project or do they contract you for multiple projects?"

    "1:15:10": "duroate Q: How do you determine what gathers in a chunk with the Z-axis? Do you grab entities from all 6 sides of the chunk?"
    "1:15:27": "Blackboard: \"Axis aligned bounding box\""

    "1:19:28": "hnau Q: I recently watched Jon Blow's talk on attempting deep work and became curious: Do you do anything similar from a psychological perspective, i.e. go dancing like Jon does or do you have some other relaxing / rewarding activity that helps to spawn creative thought or gain elusive insights into problems you are struggling to solve?"
    "1:21:08": "drtwox Q: Do you think RK4 integration is \"overkill\" for a 2D game like Handmade Hero?"

    "1:29:38": "d7samurai Q: What about having two regions - one outer and one inner, include entities that move into the inner and exclude entities that move out of the outer - so there's a \"margin\" that allows some moving without ping-ponging right across a hard in / out line?"

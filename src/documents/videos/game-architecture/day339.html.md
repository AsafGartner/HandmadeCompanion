    "54:57": "Q&A"
    "55:17": "nxsy Q: Look at the screen border while you're doing it"
    "57:17": "cyberpunkhobo Q: Entities get displaced by the modified CameraP during room transitions, I think"
    "57:52": "cyberpunkhobo Q: What if you disable the parabolic camera transition between rooms?"
    "58:27": "handmade_sim_region.cpp: Toggle off the parabolic camera, run the game and see that the entity displacement is now solid"
    "1:02:57": "handmade_world_mode.cpp: Try setting CameraP.z and then CameraP.y to 0, run the game and see how that affects it"
    "1:05:03": "handmade_entity.cpp: Note that UpdateAndRenderEntities() is erroneously using the CameraOffset.z to set the floor height, and make it use CameraP"
    "1:07:00": "handmade_particles.cpp: Make UpdateAndRenderParticleSystems() and UpdateAndRenderFire() take CameraP"
    "1:08:38": "Run the game and see that it sort of worked"
    "1:10:36": "mixthemeow Q: Full on 3D would probably be less complicated at this point"
    "1:14:33": "boogie_improper Q: What is the difference between Handmade Hero and 1935?"
    "1:14:56": "jayphi Q: So just now the fix only applied to the particles? Because the borders are still moving"
    "1:15:12": "nxsy Q: In the code, I think they mean"
    "1:19:12": "erdomina Q: Are we able to change the projection in this game?"
    "1:19:36": "zuurr_ Q: In UpdateAndRenderEntities (in handmade_entity.h) is the MovementMode_AngleAttackSwipe case missing a break or is the fall-through intentional"
    "1:19:49": "dragoonx6 Q: How far would you say you are with developing the game? How many episodes can we still expect?"
    "1:21:16": "serge_rgb Q: Do you find it difficult to context-switch between 1935 and Handmade Hero, and, if so, has it gotten easier with time?"
    "1:23:54": "Go back and end the stream"

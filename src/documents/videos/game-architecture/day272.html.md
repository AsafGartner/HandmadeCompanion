    "1:01:23": "lazerstalker Q: How did you split the head from the body?"
    "1:01:34": "ingenero Q: How interesting do you think it would be to solve for the \"force\" and direction required to reach a certain height on each jump? Is it just more work than it's worth for no tangible gain?"
    "1:02:48": "longboolean Q: I am guessing that both the familiar and enemies will need to move similarly to the hero. Is there much more you need to do to make this work with them?"
    "1:03:06": "thegeekpirate Q: Can we clean up the extra head and body on screen, or are they going to be used later on?"

    "1:15:12": "cubercaleb Q: The trees on the bottom row look like they are being clipped at the top. Also C# is compiled these days to some extent"
    "1:16:24": "sierrabrad Q: Is that a real clicky keyboard or is it just sound effects"
    "1:17:28": "ineville Q: Have you seen very much of apple's Swift? What are your thoughts on it now that it is open source?"

    "1:05:31": "powerc9k Q: Why be able to compile from the game if we can do it from the editor? Is it just to be cool?"
    "1:06:30": "ChronalDragon Q: Compile in mr4th's editor and do all of the game development work from in-game?"
    "1:06:51": "andsz_ Q: I like how it's \"STARTUPINFO\", but \"PROCESS_INFORMATION\". Inconsistency even in a single small part of the WinAPI... Do such things annoy you in a \"professional\" API?"
    "1:07:33": "Mr4thDimention Q: Why are we writing to a code file instead of just passing -D to the build line? Seems like it would be a little easier, although I have to admit you made that look pretty easy"
    "1:08:24": "cubercaleb Q: Why not use system() instead of CreateProcess()?"
    "1:09:43": "glaman1605 Q: Do you plan on reading the original config file and then rewrite with modified values?"
    "1:09:52": "TheSizik Q: Why not just set a boolean variable instead of recompiling a #define?"
    "1:10:38": "ejunkie64 Q: Will there be a dev console?"
    "1:10:50": "Pseudonym73 Q: Also, system() runs a program through CMD.EXE, which is yet another dependency"
    "1:11:57": "Lkey144 Q: The chat recommended CREATE_NO_WINDOW as a process creation flag. You could probably use that instead of the minimized window"
    "1:12:38": "Trystan34 Q: What is in the bat file that is run?"
    "1:12:48": "powerc9k Q: Why does it zoom out?"
    "1:13:02": "Radar_CS Q: Are you using sublime?"
    "1:13:07": "Quantumplation Q: Can you add a radial menu for debug camera, instead of piggybacking off toggle graph? It's bugging me"
    "1:13:19": "Shut down"

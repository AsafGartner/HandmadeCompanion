    "26:46": "Blackboard: The approximation"
    "32:21": "The ZFudge multiplies, but the equation for perspective projection is not a multiplication"
    "33:43": "Implement the equation"
    "45:04": "Take a look in-game and double-check everything"
    "47:35": "Moment of realisation: Our offset is still happening in pixels"
    "48:59": "Do the perspective computation in pixels and work on the values"

    "1:04:07": "Q&A"
    "1:04:53": "jamesamurr Q: Is squinting analogous to closing a camera's aperture?"
    "1:05:42": "stelar7 Q: Are you intending to multiply by XYZ and not just the XY as the variable says?"
    "1:06:11": "ideograham Q: Wasn't the room height 8 meters? That's about 3 times the height of a normal room, so you have to increase the focal length to compress everything"
    "1:06:54": "@drive137 Q: Expect a ton of prestream questions"
    "1:07:07": "flaturated Q: Wasn't the parameter already converted to pixels? If so then I think you are converting meters to pixels twice"
    "1:07:59": "ttbjm Q: If you wanted to use this code to make a full 3D game such as a first person shooter, how much would you have to change to give the player an adjustable FOV option?"
    "1:11:38": "sonicphi Q: How long do you think this is gonna take?"
    "1:13:02": "sonicphi Q: No OpenGL, no audio library, no anything. How's being a masochist coming along?"
    "1:14:53": "deathtenk Q: Hello! As a software developer, I understand the performance benefits of C++ are important. However, there are a lot of REPL-based code-at-runtime tools coming out that streamline development on both the web and in games. How do you feel about this departure from traditional software development tools?"
    "1:17:14": "dr_mudkip Q: Do you use iPhone? If it's a yes, I would like to give you a copy of my game for iOS"
    "1:17:34": "anonymous835 Q: Will this game have cinematic mode?"
    "1:18:07": "naysayer88 Q: I use an iPhone... for my butt"
    "1:18:29": "krohnos Q: Would the renderer be able to support something like zooming out for one screen that is twice as large as normal?"
    "1:21:23": "pseudonym73 Q: Lots of quick time events, too?"
    "1:21:34": "darrenv Q: Where about is the explanation of the reloading the code while running? It sounds like fun"
    "1:23:37": "imgudyurbad Q: What kind of game is this going to be and what will the point of it be?"
    "1:24:31": "sonicphi Q: When the game is finished, do you expect the game to look as good as if you made it in a commercial engine?"
    "1:26:31": "atomiclich Q: Can I learn how to be a better programmer from this channel?"
    "1:26:56": "panic00 Q: Are you planning any DLC for this game?"
    "1:27:48": "vercinger Q: Do you use Windows Media Center a lot in your game dev process?"
    "1:28:31": "manicthenobody Q: Why does he move slower at higher zoom?"
    "1:29:52": "insofaras Q: Will the game be fun?"
    "1:30:08": "stelar7 Q: Will you cover things like patching and downloading code from the internet?"
    "1:30:28": "sonicphi Q: Are you planing on implementing some kind of shader support?"
    "1:31:29": "ninjin420 Q: Will this game have a Collector's Edition? I want a plastic dragon in it for $150"

    "1:10:07": "Q&A Resumes"
    "1:10:36": "Is it important to clarify many of these subjects can be learned when you need them, not needed as a baseline?"
    "1:11:41": "Most of 3D games is in euclidian geometry"
    "1:12:25": "What happens in partial differential equations if Scott Meyers is in a gorilla suit.."
    "1:13:23": "Don't the tiles near the inner part of the torus get smaller compared to outside?"
    "1:15:59": "How is dealing with complex numbers in four dimensions more useful for doing rotations?"
    "1:24:39": "Ever do anything with laplace transforms?"
    "1:25:36": "What type of math is used in AI?"
    "1:26:05": "Is all of the things shown in math classes useful?"
    "1:27:01": "Quaternions as you use them in rotations are not euclidian!"
    "1:27:37": "Can we talk a bit about what out of the master list do we expect to use in this game?"
    "1:28:45": "Will the next two weeks cover the basic functionalities of the parts that are math heavy?"
    "1:29:22": "Did you learn most of your math from books or did you take courses?"
    "1:29:37": "I heard Markov chains are also useful crossing control theory with probability. Will we use these?"

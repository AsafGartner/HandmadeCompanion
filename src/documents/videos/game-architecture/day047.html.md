    "54:13": "Q&A"
    "55:25": "Why did you change from search in p to search in t?"
    "59:32": "How does it handle the state of two separate players on different floors?"
    "1:00:18": "Why is the code complexity for p-search so much bigger than t-search?"
    "1:03:19": "Why not treat the map as a matrix and validate objects and collisions through coordinates?"
    "1:04:23": "Can you elaborate more on how the coordinate system works with the collision detection?"
    "1:06:51": "Can this be extended to 3D collision?"
    "1:07:04": "Could you check the player position and check if it's in the inner side of the wall vectors?"
    "1:10:42": "What's your point on zero-length vector normalization?"
    "1:12:54": "How come sometimes players can glitch through walls or corners? Is it art or programming?"
    "1:17:04": "Do you need to do the math with solid walls and objects or is it basic program arithmetics?"
    "1:18:42": "Chat adds: I think he means graphically. Walls can be hollow inside."

    "59:26": "bkboggy Q: I noticed that you rarely comment your code. Your comments mostly consist of TODO comments. What are your thoughts on commenting your code, considering a lot of it is pretty complicated, unless of course you don't see it as such? Or do you think that since you write good code, it doesn't require comments to be readable?"

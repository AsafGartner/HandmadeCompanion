    "1:21:36": "desuused Q: Would it be reasonable to separate the debug UI into a separate program that communicates with the game over pipes / sockets? The game won't hold the debug data and won't waste cycles on debug collation, debug rendering; if game crashes, you can still inspect frames, or even save them to the disk independently of the game running"
    "1:23:09": "badflydog Q: You are referring to GlobalDebugTable outside a HANDMADE_INTERNAL guard, when you initialize it in UpdateAndRender"
    "1:23:25": "Miblo Q: Casey, your stream overlay disappeared at some point this evening. I'm pretty darn sure it might have happened out of protest when you removed the beautiful fade, so it could be worth reimplementing that, if only in the interest of overlay stability"
    "1:23:39": "elxenoaizd Q: How are you finding modular editing so far?"
    "1:24:39": "handmade.cpp: Initialise GlobalDebugTable inside HANDMADE_INTERNAL"
    "1:25:10": "cubercaleb Q: Why not use DebugBreak instead of *(int*)0=0 which will allow you to step over the assertion if you really want but will still trigger the breakpoint"
    "1:25:31": "erdomina Q: The Handmade twitter account says tomorrow is an off day"
    "1:25:37": "badflydog Q: What exactly is modular editing?"
    "1:26:09": "elxenoaizd Q: When you're writing your own renderers and stuff, do you go for a left-handed coordinate system or right-handed (for vector-matrix multiplications, etc.), and why?"
    "1:26:36": "longboolean Q: Something I noticed when you disabled the trees rendering, the white dot used to resize the profiler view is hard to see over a light background, like the text was hard to read before adding a shadow"
    "1:27:42": "zach211w Q: Do you find that commentating as you work helps you reason or helps you overall when programming?"
    "1:28:03": "elxenoaizd Q: Do you think 4coder is good enough to switch to coming from emacs? Or are you finding it's missing some stuff yet?"
    "1:29:59": "elxenoaizd Q: And vertical- / block-kill / -selection?"
    "1:30:32": "cubercaleb Q: Off topic: I noticed that pragma pack will change the alignment of the struct. Is there a way of keeping the original alignment?"
    "1:30:48": "badflydog Q: Could you share your 4coder_custom.cpp?"
    "1:32:22": "btngames Q: Do you think it would be neat to save a DebugUI \"layout\" with torn elements open as they were last?"
    "1:33:02": "mr4thdimention Q: I include it in 4coder at the $10 level"
    "1:33:30": "badflydog Q: Is it possible to use with the $5 build?"

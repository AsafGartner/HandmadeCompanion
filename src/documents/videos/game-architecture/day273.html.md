    "1:14:42": "ffsjs Q: From a beginner's perspective, it seems that in software rendering, keeping \"milliseconds per frame\" in a certain controlled boundary is somewhat in the programmer's control (depending on the code quality and orientation towards performance). Does that become more difficult when going into hardware rendering (with drivers) territory? Or is it the other way around?"

Somehow it still looks fine in motion. Smear animation is a term I could find in 30 seconds of googling"

    "1:28:33": "sssmcgrath Q: It's pretty great. Also, re: metaprogramming, did you see Per Vognsen's btree metaprogramming thingy? Apparently it copies Jeff Roberts' AVL-tree configurability scheme"

    "1:00:30": "dino27_1988 Q: Casey, at what point is it _bad_ to separate everything into multiple files, and when is it _good_?"
    "1:07:36": "dino27_1988 Q: Okay, so basically personal preference, compile time, and external impositions. Thank you very much for your answer :)"
    "1:07:46": "rohit_n Q: Does \"texture download\" on this stream mean \"glTexImage2D\"?"
    "1:10:23": "dudeinbasement1 Q: Have you ever used #pragma section(...) and grouped memory into sections, and read the map file, or have you always used this style of meta programming?"
    "1:10:51": "Cubercaleb Q: Off-topic: If you wanted to extend the hot-code reloading to work with structure changes wouldn't you have to store meta data about each struct along with information about every allocation, so that you could walk the data, adjust the data, move things around and fix pointers?"
    "1:12:14": "guitarm87 Q: Do you specifically have to say inline for functions to be inlined or does the compiler do that automagically if it finds one/several to fit?"
    "1:15:07": "Cubercaleb Q: Would you try to fix the memory in-place or would you copy it to a new memory arena?"
    "1:15:47": "dudeinbasement1 Q: Programming style - why do you have the function return on the preceeding line? Is it just so that the function name is in the first column?"
    "1:17:02": "StrangeZak Q: Yeah I don't know what the deal was, when I asked about inlining last night it blew up everywhere."
    "1:18:53": "Garryjohanson Q: I was messing around with loop unrolling by hand and got massive speedups, any idea why would that be?"
    "1:19:55": "Wind things down"

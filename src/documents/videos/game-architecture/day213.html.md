    "1:07:51": "elxenoaizd Q: I don't have much experience in it, but you mentioned the RTTI in C++ is not as good. Could you explain a bit why?"
    "1:09:54": "Culver_Fly Q: I don't quite get why you need to nest the macros for DEBUG_IFs. Can you explain it?"
    "1:16:38": "ijustwantfood Q: You mind going over your debug UI plan for those who don't know what the current plan is?"
    "1:17:31": "GoldenWH Q: Isn't metaprogramming a security hole?"
    "1:17:40": "elxenoaizd Q: I've been reading about the cost of virtual functions. Normal non-virtual functions costs a 'call' command, but with virtual we need two fetches and a call. Is that very costly in performance critical areas? Is that the reason to avoid virtuals? For me, I don't like the fact that they introduce hidden costs, makes it harder to reason about your code"
    "1:20:14": "elxenoaizd Q: I can't figure out for the life of me a way to draw an empty, non-filled Rectangle via the Win32 API. I tried SelectObject(DC, GetStockObject(NULL_BRUSH)) and then Rectangle(...) but it never draws anything [see Resources]"

    "1:28:43": "gasto5 Q: Are you one of those that thinks that previously DirectX was better than OpenGL, but now is the opposite?"
    "1:28:55": "Kemosabe76 Q: Do you know how far has metaprogramming come along in other fields? I can imagine researchers using genetic algorithms to self enhance code"

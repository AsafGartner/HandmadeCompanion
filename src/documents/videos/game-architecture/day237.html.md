    "1:10:18": "insofaras Q: I think in old OpenGL you don't even need glGenTextures, you can just pick your own arbitrary ints"

    "1:14:03": "ChronalDragon Q: Later on, after we upgrade to more modern OpenGL, will the game render into a framebuffer and then onto the same triangles, or will you just have it render directly to the main window buffer?"
    "1:15:25": "macielda Q: Before you removed the Init variable and inline initialization of the texture you were always passing 0 as the name, by the way"
    "1:15:56": "macielda Q: So there is no way to blit directly to the back buffer anymore?"
    "1:17:29": "robrobby Q: Is there a difference in speed now we use OpenGL to move the buffer to the GPU?"

    "53:39": "ChronalDragon Q: So, are we done with fonts now? Moving on to other parts of the debug?"
    "54:32": "ijustwantfood Q: So what will we be moving onto next week?"
    "55:13": "InstantKafka Q: Any chance you could use a different font for the editor? Hard to tell difference between 0s and 8s"
    "55:34": "Manicthenobody Q: It's possible that that's how it is supposed to be kerned"
    "56:57": "cubercaleb Q: Maybe it's just twitch, but the letters in Red look a bit off on the edges"
    "59:38": "elxenoaizd Q: Might be a basic question but why do we need our own font rendering? Doesn't Windows have its own font rendering functions we could call?"
    "1:01:14": "SeaOfSorrows Q: I saw you were wearing something around your forearms. Is that to treat Tendinitis? I heard about this condition from typing too much"
    "1:01:27": "abnercoimbre Q: People don't understand why a font rendering system can be complex because they think in terms of pixels. Any comments on this (only if there are no other questions)?"
    "1:01:59": "butwhynot1 Q: Can you check if your numbers are monospaced? For example, 111111 should be the same width as 999999"
    "1:03:17": "ChronalDragon Q: What happened to ZoomIt?"
    "1:04:21": "krabba Q: Not a question but I think ZoomIt is just on the desktop"
    "1:05:48": "andsz_ Q: The ones and nines don't line up the same way in game and in notepad"
    "1:06:57": "elxenoaizd Q: How do you have the background black in Mischief? I found it a bit tricky to change the background color for some reason, surprisingly!"
    "1:07:17": "nicstop Q: How do you prefer to traverse trees, loops or recursion? Why?"
    "1:07:46": "elxenoaizd Q: If you want to start your own game project, do you start from scratch, use Frameworks / API / SDKs (SFML, SDL, etc.) or use an engine (custom made by you, or one that already exists)?"
    "1:08:41": "butwhynot1 Q: They don't line up relative to each other though"
    "1:09:25": "InstantKafka Q: Any plans to add scripting or modding hooks?"
    "1:09:53": "cubercaleb Q: Off-topic: How do you grep with your Emacs config?"
    "1:10:41": "abnercoimbre Q: Sure. Some (reasonably) think of the screen as a grid of pixels and that font rendering is directly plastering that font on the screen. So nvm, they just haven't understood beyond bitmap fonts"
    "1:11:46": "constantinopol Q: What font do you use in Emacs?"
    "1:12:19": "nickrolfe Q: Why did you use GlyphIndexFromCodePoint instead of an array of (mostly null) pointers to achieve sparseness?"
    "1:13:18": "Mr4thDimention Q: How valuable do you think non-mono-spaced fonts would be in, say, an editor?"
    "1:14:10": "DryZilla Q: Could you recommend a website or YouTuber that could teach me coding? I really want to learn"
    "1:16:45": "elxenoaizd Q: I like to limit the scope of my functions to be defined only where they're used. How do you workaround the fact that C doesn't have locally defined functions? Do you use functors?"
    "1:17:48": "constantinopol Q: Vertical cursor navigation is easier to follow in a mono font"
    "1:18:05": "cubercaleb Q: Tried to use grep in Emacs: the program crashed"
    "1:18:26": "elxenoaizd Q: How do you handle introspection / metadata to build your editor inspection tools?"
    "1:19:05": "Wind it down"

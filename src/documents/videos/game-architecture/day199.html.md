    "1:00:57": "ingenero Q: Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but is it desired behavior for the \"tear\" feature to tear all groups below it even if they are on the same level in the hierarchy? I would think you would only want to tear the current group and subgroups, not other groups on the same level. For example, you wouldn't want the \"profile\" group to get torn when you tear the \"particles\" group"

    "1:08:34": "branigor Q: Will there be a menu system like pressing start in Zelda to change items? Nothing fancy, but just something to get us started on how to do it"

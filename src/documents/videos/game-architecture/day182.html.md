    "1:02:38": "elxenoaizd Q: What do you think is an effective way to get better at assembly? Go over a book / tutorial? Read the code disassembly in VS? Mike Acton can look at a piece of code for a couple of seconds and estimate how many cycles it takes and what the assembly code for it is. I'd like to reach that level one day"
    "1:04:57": "Pseudonym73 Q: We're actually a pre-recorded laugh track"
    "1:05:08": "insofaras Q: How would you deal with switching between multiple APIs in a single application (like software / hardware renderer)? Would it be structured similar to the platform layer?"
    "1:11:35": "elxenoaizd Q: Why don't compilers expose API that gives us information about our code (access to the AST, etc.)? Because when we write a top-down parser we're essentially writing something that the compiler already has"
    "1:14:35": "OriginalName667 Q: Are you still using the software renderer or did you move over to DirectX or OpenGL?"
    "1:14:40": "CaptainKraft Q: At what point does a person become a good programmer? When do you think you became a good programmer?"
    "1:15:46": "elxenoaizd Q: How do you handle programmer burnout / depression? Those days when you're just not in the mood to do anything, not productive, you're demotivated, you can barely do any coding, you'd rather do 'anything' else other than what you should be doing"
    "1:17:39": "inliferty Q: Do you really prefer to save two unconditional jumps (so the CPU pipeline won't be flushed at any chance) instead of Compiler & Platform Independence (referring to the GetThreadId part)?"
    "1:18:48": "thegujhack Q: Why are you making an engine instead of a game?"
    "1:21:27": "elxenoaizd Q: Do you think implementing a regex matcher is worth it / useful for meta programming?"
    "1:21:41": "obiwanus Q: You seem to be pretty unhappy with the quality of modern software. Do you think programmers were better in the past? Is the software you produce always flawless and bugless? Asking seriously, just trying to understand your point more clearly. Thanks (!quote 225)"
    "1:27:21": "Wrap it up"

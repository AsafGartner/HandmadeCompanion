    "1:09:11": "duroate Q: Is the familiar going to be programmed to be able to go through the stairwell or instantly teleported to the floor?"
    "1:10:04": "jackkrozzer Q: When are we going to do priority for which sprite is in front and in the background? (I don't know what that is called)"
    "1:12:02": "duroate Q: You mentioned that you'll be able to attack from below / above. Will you be able to do that on the stairwell?"
    "1:12:59": "thisdyingsoul Q: I've just started to see your videos, but you already talked / programmed about entity systems. Will you use it here?"
    "1:14:00": "ps4tv Q: Does the scope of this application include moving environments, so you will need to introduce logic to detect movement of assets?"
    "1:14:50": "insofaras Q: Will the game have color grading for different areas, e.g. the blue & black cloak the hero wears might appear as two other colors in some lighting conditions?"
    "1:16:00": "ifingerbangedurcat Q: What are the piece groups and how are they used / useful for our current use in sprite rendering?"
    "1:17:15": "vashnare Q: Can you please, forgive my French, somehow un *** the net coding for DayZ Standalone and finish what Dean \"Rocket\" Hall gave up on?"
    "1:18:17": "jackkrozzer Q: Will enemies follow you upstairs or down? If they do, how will the space outside the camera work?"
    "1:18:44": "gaudongaming Q: How will you handle sprite animation? Are you using a library and have you ever hear of the Spine 2D skeleton animation framework?"
    "1:19:51": "jackkrozzer Q: Who is that guy? [see Resources]"
    "1:21:37": "jackkrozzer Q: I mean with there being different floors will it be different? I am assuming not"
    "1:22:48": "xghost7 Q: Can you run this game so some of us see its current state?"
    "1:26:54": "jackkrozzer Q: Okay, so you know how we have the camera space and then there's a space outside that we can't see but entities are still moving? Will we need to edit that code to make it work on \"Vertical\" floors? It's okay if you don't get it. I may be thinking too far in"
    "1:28:02": "shadowrelic Q: Would we use a fixed, discrete animation for moving up and down stairs a la Link to the Past, or would the goal be to make movement seamless?"
    "1:29:04": "xghost7 Q: How much lines of code do you have at the moment?"
    "1:29:55": "That is the end"

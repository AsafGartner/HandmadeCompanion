    "1:05:34": "bryanwwag Q: Could normal maps be render targets here with appropriate enums / branching to blend / light, or do they still belong outside of the current render targets array?"
    "1:06:14": "realist_01 Q: Do you think you could transform this game into a network game that multiple players can have different kinds of character assets, and, if yes, will you consider doing it?"
    "1:06:41": "thesizik Q: As in, it looked like there might be an X-Y swap in those two variables"

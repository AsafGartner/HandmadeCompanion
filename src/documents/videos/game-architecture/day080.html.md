markers:
    "57:57": "Q&A"
    "58:14": "a_pulsing_mage Q: Can you explain the LengthOf(array) macro, and the sizeof pointers?"
    "1:06:19": "ttbjm Q: Will the space entities be used for the collision optimization you were talking about in an earlier stream? o(n^2) stuff"
    "1:07:18": "insofaras Q: sizeof(game_input::Controllers) works for me with g++"
    "1:08:09": "kknewkles Q: I noticed that you tend to mostly skip over questions past the first question mark. Is it because you just parse that way or the rest tends to be not much interesting?"
    "1:09:03": "garlandobloom Q: For things like the projectiles, are we going to extend their bounding boxes in the Z axis so they will always hit enemies that are below them? Or are we going to handle that in screen space somehow?"
    "1:10:04": "dmitsuki Q: Do you dislike templates?"
    "1:11:17": "samfosteriam Q: How will you handle something like an explosion that affects all things in an area? Then it's not 1 entity colliding with another"
    "1:12:09": "flynnspixel Q: What do you think about the new Vulkan API?"
    "1:13:15": "Wrap things up"

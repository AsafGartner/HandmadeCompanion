    "1:05:10": "Q: You mentioned offloading ground drawing to a separate thread to prevent hitches. Is it possible to offload the drawing work over multiple frames, and would there be any benefits over either method?"
    "1:06:30": "Q: How much of a memory footprint is your game using already? Certainly it won't be large, but I'm more meaning how many different containers are there?"

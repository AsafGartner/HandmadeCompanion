## Quotes

* 417\. I apologise, DebugIDs. I was saying you were extraneous, but really you seem pretty sanely designed and I don't think there's any reason to get rid of you because it looks like you're doing a useful thing (11:27)
* 418\. Sorry, man in the tree (22:46)
* 419\. We clone because we care (53:20)
* 420\. By the way, I can still hear helicopters outside, so I'm assuming the guy in the tree is still in the tree (58:45)

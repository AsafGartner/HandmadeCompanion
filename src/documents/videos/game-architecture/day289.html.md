    "1:04:48": "neitchzehrer Q: Is there a limit to the colors you can have?"
    "1:05:33": "longboolean Q: Will you need to have an entity type at some level, like when generating the world, placing trees and whatnot?"

    "1:13:24": "dudeinbasement1 Q: Thoughts on avoiding denormalized floating-point on console platforms? Do they all have a -ffast-math?"
    "1:14:21": "neitchzehrer Q: My apologies. Yes, limits in the game design"

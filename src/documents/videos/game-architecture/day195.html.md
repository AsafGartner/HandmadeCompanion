    "1:06:28": "elxenoaizd Q: Why aren't the + and - signs not shown for the group labels?"
    "1:07:21": "elxenoaizd Q: Instead of manually typing values of power of 2 for our debug text enums can't we just use 1 << 1, 1 << 2, etc.?"
    "1:07:39": "cubercaleb Q: So is THIS what you meant by IMGUI?"
    "1:08:07": "TheSizik Q: Colored text option for V4's representing colors?"
    "1:08:15": "insofaras Q: Will you be adding string type debug variables, maybe for things like save folder location, keybindings etc.?"
    "1:08:35": "elxenoaizd Q: Why can't we use LLVM in windows? That way we use the same compiler for our major platforms"
    "1:09:13": "ifingerbangedurcat Q: printf comes from a library, we must implement string formatting so the stream isn't based on a lie"
    "1:11:51": "insofaras Q: If you had to implement an encryption system, would you use a library or write it from scratch yourself?"
    "1:12:01": "KRUZAA Q: (Off topic) How long after getting his / her number should you text / call them?"

    "1:12:28": "insofaras Q: You can debug LLVM things using the Visual Studio UI [see Resources]"
    "1:12:45": "Longboolean Q: Would it be possible to compile all possible combinations of debug vars as separate binaries but then only use the one that matches the chosen debug vars, for faster switching? Is this a stupid question?"
    "1:16:42": "Sharlock93 Q: What is the end goal for the Debug GUI? Like, at what point will we say this is done?"
    "1:17:02": "budsan Q: In case the debug variables header is messed up, can we check easily if a debug variable is not defined and set some default value?"
    "1:17:20": "elxenoaizd Q: How would you implement your own string without having them being null terminated? Bundle the char* with a count variable?"

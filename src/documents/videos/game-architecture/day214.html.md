    "59:55": "btnGames Q: Persisting the DEBUGValue between live code loading is great, I didn't understand what you were doing but then I got it with the demo, really cool. I had conflated the value of a variable with the value of debug of the variable. Small addition for a huge benefit"
    "1:02:20": "btnGames Q: Are you sad that you didn't fix Collation? If no more questions come in it would be neat to see it now, so you're not sad"
    "1:02:49": "Mr4thDimention Q: Will you have time tomorrow to look at 4coder? I am trying to decide whether to prioritize getting the new demo out tomorrow morning"

    "1:06:19": "Manicthenobody Q: I quote \"instead of writing debug_event Name = initiator((AnotherVar = something, something)); make a struct constructor debug_event (&AnotherVar, something) that initiates the value\""
    "1:07:55": "desuused Q: So that you don't do assignment in the function call in the macro, which makes me really saaaad"

## Quotes

* 289\. Let's go ahead and make DEBUGInitializeValue work in some way that makes some sense to somebody sometime somewhere (19:51)
* 290\. There probably is a better way to do this and... we... should... do... that... better way... now (25:27)
* 291\. Everyone loves GetGroupForName. Don't you? I do, I think. I'm not sure (31:42)
* 292\. If we were going to be super fancy about it, if we were going to, like, double up on the fanciness, now with extra fanciness... (32:07)

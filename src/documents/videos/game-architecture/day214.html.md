## Quotes

* 289\. Let's go ahead and make DEBUGInitializeValue work in some way that makes some sense to somebody sometime somewhere (19:51)
* 290\. There probably is a better way to do this and... we... should... do... that... better way... now (25:27)
* 291\. Everyone loves GetGroupForName. Don't you? I do, I think. I'm not sure (31:42)
* 292\. If we were going to be super fancy about it, if we were going to, like, double up on the fanciness, now with extra fanciness... (32:07)

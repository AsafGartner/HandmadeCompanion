    "1:18:30": "Miblo Q: The other day ingenero likened the new movement to Crypt of the Necrodancer. I like that game and see where they're coming from, but Handmade Hero already looks like it feels so much sweeter to play"
    "1:19:04": "ffsjs Q: I've probably missed it, but what exactly prompted switching the hero movement from analogue-rolling to digital-tile-based-wiggle-hopping?"
    "1:19:44": "cpots Q: Does math exist?"
    "1:19:47": "indie_d Q: Is the body always going to move on a fixed grid?"
    "1:20:38": "is_matt Q: Can we get a keyboard cam?"
    "1:20:52": "bluemelon555 Q: Will the player be able to see the points in the design"
    "1:21:13": "macielda Q: Is the body going to lean towards the head or is it gonna stay detached?"
    "1:22:04": "indie_d Q: Shouldn't the head always draw on top of the cape?"
    "1:23:31": "trevnewt Q: Will other entities only travel on these points, too? Or can they move freely?"
    "1:24:08": "cvaucher Q: Is there a name for this technique of blending canned and simulated animations? Is it a common thing allowed in animation / 3D packages?"
    "1:26:16": "macielda Q: Why would I use an animation package instead of doing what you just did (and whatever you will do)?"
    "1:28:56": "trevnewt Q: Is there any plan for eventual addition of music?"
    "1:29:34": "garryjohanson Q: Ham-handed Q, could you use neural networks and make something like Boston Dynamics 'BigDog'?"
    "1:31:17": "Close it up"

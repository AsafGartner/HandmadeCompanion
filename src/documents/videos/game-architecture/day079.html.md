    "1:05:07": "nigna Q: What setup do you use for debugging on Linux?"
    "1:07:01": "t3amkill3r Q: Can you upload the videos somewhere else? YouTube is blocked in China. I would like to watch from the beginning"
    "1:07:44": "l4t33d Q: When doing the vertical movement, would it be reasonable to take two measurements: one at current position, then one at \"final moved\" position, and average the movement?"
    "1:08:27": "ishytarus Q: Are walls going to be entities, or just byproducts of the subtracting of the room volume?"
    "1:09:00": "zuurr_ Q: LLDB works better than GDB, if you can deal with the command line interface"
    "1:09:40": "djohnstone8 Q: Should you have been able to jump up to a level above the player now that you have a .9 value for the Space Z volume?"
    "1:10:24": "zamar037 Q: Will the entities not at the player's Z level always be at the same alpha transparency or will they be slightly less visible to show that they are on a different Z level?"
    "1:11:54": "rexterrawtf Q: Why should anyone trust you to annotate a game when you have no published success preparing a full-fledged commercial game?"
    "1:12:48": "h_y_p_e_r Q: If you were a software programmer, how many apps could you have done in the same amount of time you have put into this?"
    "1:13:51": "blah238 Q: Will there be water, and how would it affect movement?"
    "1:14:46": "Reminder: Water that you can swim in, maybe with currents too?"
    "1:15:16": "quikligames Q: Does the system used for the ground now make it harder to have things like moving platforms the player can stand on?"
    "1:15:30": "Reminder: Moving platforms the player can stand on"
    "1:15:55": "hdudley Q: Was the use of calculus involved in your programming? [see Resources]"
    "1:16:42": "brblackmer Q: For this scheme, will the room geometries need to overlap in order to move between rooms, or can they just abut?"
    "1:17:24": "stiegosaurus Q: Can you illustrate how they do the level editors / world layouts in modern engines now?"
    "1:19:08": "dkilmer Q: Are you going to use files to store levels? If so, will they be custom format?"
    "1:19:33": "h_y_p_e_r Q: Would the combat algorithm in a 2D game differ from a 3D game?"
    "1:20:05": "poohshoes Q: How can I work with other programmers when our coding styles clash?"
    "1:21:06": "rpdublee Q: Should there be walls around stairwells now, or will we still just use the collision rules from before?"
    "1:21:29": "zenatsu Q: Are you going to procedurally build levels, or pre-defined levels?"
    "1:21:43": "marksands Q: Will wee see stuff like light sources, ray tracing, surface mapping, etc. at some point in this stream?"
    "1:22:21": "nigna Q: Have we started doing collision detection and handling? If no, how detailed will it have to be?"
    "1:22:46": "dkilmer Q: What do you think about storing game data in code?"
    "1:23:59": "protongaming Q: So you will continue complaining about Windows while making money programming with it and Visual Studio?"
    "1:30:30": "panic00 Q: Can you rename the stream to Casey's Little Kindergarten?"
    "1:30:58": "protongaming Q: One day you said you lost hope in Microsoft, and now you say you complain so they can fix it?"
    "1:33:58": "dasmehdi Q: Was git an example, or do you feel there are problems with it? Curious to hear"
    "1:35:42": "Call it there"

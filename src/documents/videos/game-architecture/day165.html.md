    "1:04:52": "Sharlock93 Q: Hey Casey, can you do a 2-min recap of everything done today?"
    "1:07:49": "andsz_ Q: How often do you actually implement something from a paper?"
    "1:08:45": "SvK151 Q: What would be the worst case scenario if you had multiple threads trying to remove an asset? Couldn't you just wait till no thread was trying to remove the asset?"
    "1:09:14": "Pseudonym73 Q: One way to avoid the lock is to split the LRU list into two parts. Keep the most recent 25% of it in one partition and the least recent 75% in another. Only move an asset to the head of the list if it's in the least recent part"
    "1:09:54": "JamesWidman Q: So IIUC, our problem is that \"least recently used\", in this context, means \"least-recently-stopped-being-used-in-all-threads\", and we can't really know that for certain without having some form of inter-thread communication.... Is that correct?"

    "1:13:18": "Pseudonym73 Q: You don't take the lock on hot assets most of the time"
    "1:14:14": "Sharlock93 Q: I haven't seen you drink any milk this stream, is that why you are tired?!"
    "1:14:56": "EzyFool Q: You can avoid the genid gap checking list by keeping min/max/cnt rendergroup \"done\" ids, and freeing all assets <max when cnt = max - min, then reset min=max. Not the best if you want to free ASAP all the time. and the window gets large"
    "1:17:45": "EzyFool Q: You know the min rendergroup that completed, but like you mentioned at the start, if they complete out of order, the min isn't..."
    "1:18:31": "EzyFool Q: ...correct when a gap occurs, so you need to track the interval and jump ahead when it fills. But maybe I'm just misunderstanding the situation"
    "1:19:40": "Vargolindo Q: I'm at the Day 19 video (improving audio sync) and in order to get timeBeginPeriod to work I had to call it twice. Do you have any idea why?"
    "1:21:07": "hitmanatee Q: Any update on what algorithm you are using to do laundry these days?"
    "1:21:50": "EzyFool Q: Never mind, my keyboard & my internet seem to be dying, I'll wait 'til tomorrow"
    "1:22:11": "Sharlock93 Q: I think we should do a detour and make a simple ray tracer"
    "1:22:43": "Wind it down"

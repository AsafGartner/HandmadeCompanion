    "53:23": "Q&A"
    "54:13": "Why can’t infrequent entity updates happen in the entity’s update logic?"
    "56:57": "Why do you want to use a 3D vector for position when the Z value is always going to be an integer?"
    "1:01:25": "Does Minkowski collision detection have to be axis-aligned?"
    "1:03:06": "Didn’t you just implement a bare-bones relational database? Do you think that’s a good mental model for understanding today’s code?"
    "1:05:57": "I noticed your characters do not collide with each-other. I thought you changed that?"
    "1:07:08": "How good is this addressing scheme for the cache?"
    "1:08:02": "When jumping you just need x, y, z coordinates to make it happen? [code changes]"
    "1:16:23": "Will we switch to some kind of sparse storage for example for the high res entities?"
    "1:16:54": "How would you handle jumping on a ledge or surface to adopt a new base height?"
    "1:18:19": "What do you think about physics for character or mob movement in a platformer game, meaning that I press right but it starts to accelerate instead of just move?"
    "1:19:16": "Now make him jump through the ceiling into the next floor."
    "1:19:54": "Why is he so huge?"
    "1:20:27": "Will the floor area of the zones be flat or will it have slopes and 3D zones a.k.a. hills?"
    "1:22:09": "Can you change the yellow tile beneath his feet quickly and easily to be greyish and round so it looks like a jumping shadow? Completely not required but why not! [code change]"
    "1:26:21": "If you add walls in the middle of rooms would they be handled as entities for the purpose of collision detection or separately?"
    "1:27:04": "Too fast!"
    "1:30:35": "How much has changing the rectangle to a bitmap instead of a rectangle impacted your player-on-player collision calculation?"
    "1:30:53": "How many zombie DLCs will there be?"
    "1:32:02": "Shouldn’t you be doing this blending in a linear color space?"
    "1:33:06": "When does the core mechanics of the game come into play? Earlier or later in the dev cycle?"
    "1:35:19": "Is there an easy way to translate from circle to ellipse collision detection?"
    "1:35:50": "Do you recommend learning to make a game engine rather than using engines like Unity or Unreal for people new to game development?"
    "1:37:50": "The rectangle box which you have alpha assigned, is that the same box you would assign hit points to in case the character is injured by enemies or obstacles?"
    "1:39:05": "How common or practical is pixel by pixel collision check vs overall shapes collision check? Which one is more interesting to you?"
    "1:39:50": "What are your thoughts on the Allegro library?"
    "1:40:00": "Stream end"

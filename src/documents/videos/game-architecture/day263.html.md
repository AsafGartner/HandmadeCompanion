* 461\. You feel me, dawg? (1:56)
* 462\. Nice work Muratori. You're off the team (26:20)
* 463\. I'm gonna make that be yellow, because yellow is the color of... urine. Which is an essential by-product. And Gandhi drank it, supposedly. I wasn't there... (28:21)
* 464\. What? Who wrote this ridiculous code? That's garbage (42:20)

    "1:05:13": "vidster88 Q: You've talked a lot about languages lately, have you taken a look at Swift at all? Thoughts?"
    "1:05:31": "elxenoaizd Q: How do you come up with that literacy stuff? That was Awesome! :D"

    "1:08:40": "luijee Q: Off topic but how old were you when you started coding"
    "1:08:47": "a_pulsing_mage Q: prestream question: do you think that intel hitting the proccesa size limit will make video game falter of will they survive?"
    "1:09:33": "mitch77x Q: Casey, you are as old as me. Are you also planning to retire from working ASAP ? :-)"
    "1:10:58": "falsemann Q: What do you think about Test-Driven Development?"

    "1:16:55": "elxenoaizd Q: sometimes I compare myself with other great programmers and get depressed cause I'm far away from their level - I know I shouldn't be comparing cause they grew up in different environments etc and I know for sure I can reach their level if I apply myself and learn quick, but sometimes it just gets to me and I feel bad about it... have you ever felt that way? any tips how to overcome it?"
    "1:23:10": "gasto5 Q: Do you think Japanese not adopting the OOP paradigm is because they are smarter or simply because of not even being interested in changing to new languages?"
    "1:23:46": "jayp2 Q: Pseudo coder question: How would one go about learning Assembly language? And are compilers/linkers written in that?"

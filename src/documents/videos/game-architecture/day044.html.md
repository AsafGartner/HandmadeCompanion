    "58:13": "Q&A"
    "59:31": "Can you explain again why the hero was sticking against the wall?"
    "1:02:43": "When do we scale down the hero?"
    "1:03:11": "Have you considered using sin(0) to sin(90) as a non-linear inertia curve?"
    "1:03:51": "Will you eventually handle player and monsters in some kind of physics engine?"
    "1:04:32": "Do you need to code in different collision detection for the enemies?"
    "1:05:09": "Will you add comments to the source for those who preordered?"
    "1:05:45": "Do you plan on having non axis-aligned walls in the maps?"
    "1:07:12": "What do you think about position based dynamics?"
    "1:08:42": "Are we going to do continuous collision detection?"
    "1:09:08": "Is the computational cost of functions something you only learn by experience?"
    "1:11:08": "Will you end up in problems when walking into corners after the sticking fix tomorrow?"
    "1:11:27": "Will there be a minimum distance to the wall?"
    "1:12:03": "Will computing a vector where the player will stop just before the wall solve the sticking?"
    "1:13:13": "Additional explanation to the bounce vector calculation"
    "1:19:25": "Is there a way to speed up the DrawBitmap -code?"
    "1:21:15": "Suggestion to remove reblitting the background to improve performance"
    "1:22:08": "Stream notes Casey drew the cos/sin triangle wrong"
    "1:23:39": "A wish to mention formal keywords to help people look things up"
    "1:24:53": "Was the Witness collision trick to try maintain the distance traveled?"
    "1:25:21": "Why does wall bouncing not seem to cause sticking, but sliding does?"
    "1:27:06": "Stream mentions KhanAchademy for learning math"
    "1:27:20": "Will the rendering code be able to squash bitmaps?"
    "1:28:01": "Could you/would you benefit from unrolling the collision loop ... ?"

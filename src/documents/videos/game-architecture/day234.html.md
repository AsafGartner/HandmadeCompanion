    "1:03:56": "fod669 Q: Your radix sort looks like it's O(8n) because you're doing two passes over the list per byte. Couldn't you make it O(5n) by getting all the offsets / counts in one pass at the cost of 3 more 256 element arrays?"
    "1:06:19": "elxenoaizd Q: Off-topic: I'm a bit confused about axis-angle rotations vs quaternion rotations. I thought quaternions do represent an angle and axis of rotation. What's the difference?"

    "21:27": "We're filling correctly but inefficiently"
    "21:58": "Consider restricting the area that DrawRectangleSlowly marches over"
    "22:21": "Blackboard: How does that help us do our rotation and scaling?"
    "23:25": "Blackboard: Can't we just test against four corners of our rectangle?"

    "34:03": "Notice that, because we're not doing the dot product, the sign doesn't flip"
    "34:33": "Make greater-than be our standard"
    "35:03": "Blackboard: Think of the surface normals pointing outwards"
    "35:20": "Change all of those edge functions to be negative"

    "59:38": "Blackboard: How we want the Perp to work"
    "1:00:26": "Make that Perp work"
    "1:01:13": "ttbjm Q: Is downscaling bitmaps correctly slower than upscaling (more colour points to blend)?"

    "1:05:33": "cubercaleb Q: Eventually, will you implement anti-aliasing into the rendering of the rectangle, or is that too much for the CPU?"
    "1:06:07": "Blackboard: Texture sampling handles anti-aliasing for the alpha'd bitmaps"
    "1:07:57": "Check out our hilarious little shape and review our progress"
    "1:09:37": "garlandobloom Q: Historically, did we ever do anti-aliasing with CPU rendering?"
    "1:11:52": "Postpone anything more until tomorrow, with a potential plan of action"

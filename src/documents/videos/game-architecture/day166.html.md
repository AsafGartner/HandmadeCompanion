    "1:05:43": "mmozeiko Q: Please don't cast Value to (long*) for __sync_fetch_and_add, it will generate wrong code on 64-bit Linux/OSX"
    "1:06:17": "RobotChocolateDino Q: What's the advantage of calling load bitmaps from other threads? Wouldn't it be better to just have PushBitmap fail when called from other threads so that there are no assets missing from the ground chunks and so that all the bitmap memory could be acquired on the main thread? The ground chunks could probably wait one frame to have their assets loaded if they are prefetched ahead of time"
    "1:07:23": "powerc9k Q: Is the Github repo online and if so how does one gain access?"

    "1:09:36": "jessem3y3r Q: How difficult would it be to have the letter particles fall independently of the hero?"
    "1:17:20": "Stephenlast Q: Don't you need to move all ground chunk work into the separate thread? ATM it looks like it's only actually doing render to output in the task"
    "1:18:23": "OsmanTheBlack Q: Why are you using u64 instead of size_t for buffer sizes?"
    "1:19:21": "AlejRad Q: Why are you using windows?"
    "1:21:19": "Stephenlast Q: I only ask because for now it seems like you will be stalling for that LoadBitmap on the main thread"
    "1:34:59": "mvargasmoran Q: How difficult would be to make this boot alone in a Raspberry Pi or something like that?"
    "1:35:11": "OsmanTheBlack Q: load_asset_work for u64 !size_t"
    "1:36:08": "RobotChocolateDino Q: Would dedicating one thread to asset loaded which has an atomic queue be a bad idea?"
    "1:37:39": "Wind it down"

    "1:02:07": "Miblo Q: Thanks to the grid partitioning, do we now have a convenient way of doing the graph sort in SIMD, possibly processing four grid squares, or four sprites within a square, at once? Or is it not quite that simple?"
    "1:05:38": "themikedx Q: With regards to the flags and the order checking, if you are &ing the flags with the id, to test if you have seen it before, what happens when another item does the same check and &s it with the same (changed) unit? Doesn't that make the result different to the check flags & mask = id for the new item? Did I miss something (or did you & the flags with the mask before you set the id to clear it (the old id) first?"

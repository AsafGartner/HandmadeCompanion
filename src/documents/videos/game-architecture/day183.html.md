    "1:03:11": "Hotspur_ Q: Are you going to start the hardware renderer before starting on game logic? Or are you going to wait until software doesn't cut it? Or are you waiting for Vulkan?"
    "1:04:09": "TheiBurley Q: Do you just use the blue line selector and green cursor to make it easier to follow on stream, or is that how you normally like it? I feel like it would get fatiguing on the eyes"
    "1:04:34": "elxenoaizd Q: When do you think it is a good idea to use somebody else's library / system instead of implementing our own? (e.g. Do you use anything from the C standard library?)"
    "1:07:08": "cubercaleb Q: Missed the first half of the stream, are you saving the past 60 frames into a buffer?"
    "1:07:40": "elxenoaizd Q: If a miracle happens and C++ starts doing things right and addresses the issues in the implementations of most of their features, would you use their features like templates etc., or stick to metaprogramming etc.?"

    "59:17": "culver_fly Q: Sorry if it sounds rude, but why do you even care about the specs? Why don't you just print whatever you want it to be? I mean, it's your code?"

    "1:03:12": "3ygun Q: Minimum width would make it more consistent across all types of printf"
    "1:03:24": "programgamer Q: So wait, is it a behavior problem or a bad spec problem?"
    "1:04:04": "elxenoanizd Q: Do you think it's worth implementing a custom string class that uses a custom heap for allocation and disposition of memory instead of dealing directly with null-terminated C-strings (talking mostly for tools programming)?"

    "1:10:08": "music_guru Q: What else is left other than printf that would need to be removed?"

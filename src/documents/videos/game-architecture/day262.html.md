The obvious solution would be to draw them with a slight offset from the last each time, but are there any problems with that once the rectangles get really small?"

* 455\. If you're not on the 4coder bandwagon yet, I'm not really sure what to say. I guess you're just using a lousy editor. Sorry (3:29)
* 466\. Arrrgggghhhhhh (17:20)
* 467\. We're just gonna make this a very quiet, dignified edit (18:12)
* 468\. Consider yourself so very lucky (20:42)

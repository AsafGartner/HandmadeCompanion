    "1:08:27": "andsz_ Q: A fairly simple way to describe or understand the infinity norm is to draw the unit hyperspheres for each of those common norms. The 1-norm would be a diamond shape, 2-norm is the regular circle / hypersphere, 3-norm gets more squareish / hypercubish and so on. You'd quickly see that this series converges towards a square / hypercube"
    "1:09:02": "filiadelski Q: Have you seen Scott Meyer's talk on CPU caches? He talks about how it's better to store data of the same type together in memory because they end up on the same cache line, which is good for performance. Is this something that you think about, or will cover in Handmade Hero?"
    "1:11:22": "blah238 Q: Could you use the entity pairing concept for a vehicle-occupant relationship, like an airship and its passenger(s)? And, if so, (how) would movement work on it?"
    "1:11:44": "stevoid1990 Q: I was just wondering why you don't have a subscriber button for those that enjoy your frequent broadcasts. From what I gather you were offered partnership but turned it down due to something in the contract. Can you tell me a little why you made that decision and what options do you have to donate?"
    "1:15:10": "guitarm87 Q: Is it not possible to subscribe to forum posts anymore now since the new stuff was made I don't get any posts to my mail"
    "1:15:57": "omnitechnomancer Q: Subscribe doesn't make it ad-free anymore, as far as I know"
    "1:18:29": "Mr4thDimention Q: This entity reference stuff feels premature to me since I don't think we have a lot of examples of how it will be used. Are you doing it now for a particular reason?"
    "1:21:25": "Close down"

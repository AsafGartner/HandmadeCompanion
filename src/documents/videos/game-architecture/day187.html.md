    "1:01:05": "quartertron Q: What's your favourite bug of all time?"
    "1:01:48": "serge_rgb Q: Often when I'm debugging, I have to stop myself from changing stuff at random because of mental laziness, hoping for \"an even number of sign errors\". Do you ever have that urge? If so, has it diminished as you have become more experienced? [see Resources]"
    "1:05:19": "CaptainKraft Q: Doesn't it go against your philosophy of \"write the code as you need it\" to make a debugger like this before the game needs much debugging?"
    "1:07:21": "Arconyx Q: Is there any way to keep familiar with old code or is working with it frequently the only way?"
    "1:10:49": "aameen95 Q: @Mok actually found the bug and @AndreasK actually figured why it is causing what was happening by looking at the assembly. The compiler decided to not inline the call in the constructor and inline it in the destructor so the start marker is wrong and the end marker is right"
    "1:12:21": "Stephenlast Q: It looked like that FRAME_MARKER was going past this TODO: \"// TODO(casey): Move this to a global variable so that there can be timers below this one?\""
    "1:13:14": "win32_handmade.cpp: Move that TODO down and check if GlobalDebugTable exists"
    "1:14:07": "quartertron Q: Do you really care about compilation units or just threads? Hash the thread IDs"
    "1:14:46": "SedihGlow Q: Do you write code for this project off stream, for fun or speed?"
    "1:15:24": "slash1221 Q: If I don't have a credit card, is there another way to buy it?"
    "1:16:09": "CaptainKraft Q: You brought up your devlog: do you think that writing a devlog is good for the writer, the readers, or both?"
    "1:16:25": "CaptainKraft Q: It sounds like the debugger is not only a tool to find out what is going wrong, but to detect when things are going to go wrong. Is that a fair assumption? I never thought of a debugger as something that keeps me \"situationally aware\". That sounds like a great idea"
    "1:17:46": "We have come to the end of the stream"

## Quotes

* 239\. We really need a reverse Owl of Shame. Maybe like if the Owl of Shame is backwards, or something? That's like an Owl of Success (20:18)
* 238\. I'm sorry Dave, I can't... I can't save the file (47:21)

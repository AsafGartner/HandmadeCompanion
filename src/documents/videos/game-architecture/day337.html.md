    "1:05:52": "mmozeiko Q: On MSVC it is possible to create non-member inline operator += for __m128. It is done in same way as you did for v2/v3/v4 types. But for gcc / clang you cannot do += for __m128, because they already have it builtin operator"
    "1:06:33": "handmade_particles.h: Tweak &operator+=()"
    "1:07:30": "soysaucethekid Q: Instead of doing the particle_v3 struct, could you accomplish the same thing with macros and some pointer math?"
    "1:08:26": "phort99 Q: How much of your time would you say you spend refactoring as compared to writing new code?"
    "1:11:38": "a_pulsing_mage Q: Have you changed the way the particles look? If so, please show them"
    "1:12:53": "macielda Q: Do you often write code using SIMD without a non-SIMD implementation of the same operation?"
    "1:14:10": "phort99 Q: If JAI releases before the end of this project and is good enough, would you ever consider rewriting the project in JAI, or is the project too big and the gains too small?"
    "1:15:48": "macielda Q: Is it hard to debug SIMD in Linux? Have you tried it?"
    "1:17:04": "longboolean Q: It would be cool to see a stream or two of a good programmer (you) going through the motions of learning JAI"

    "1:16:50": "quartertron Q: I imagine that all the \"paths\" will be known at compile time, so you probably don't need to do strcmp but I'm not sure if just using the addresses would work"
    "1:17:24": "ezysigh Q: By the way, I tried decltype() on clang and it worked in the same kind of context (I think). cl is probably broken"
    "1:17:43": "kaesve Q: Can you give us some programming challenges for until you get back?"
    "1:18:22": "Dragonmaster047 Q: Would it be viable to write a game that uses a database model and its logic as database transformations?"
    "1:20:42": "MartinCohen Q: My mind cannot stop thinking about the scratch memory thing you talked with Jon the other day on the pre-stream, so I'm sorry if this is off-topic. It was a piece of memory that is kept per thread (and grows a little). Do I understand it correctly that you're passing it down the call stack, so that each function can push and pop a piece of scratch memory from it?"
    "1:22:06": "Mysterious_J_ Q: I've never thought about metaprogramming much before, and it sounds really interesting. Do you have any recommendations for more information on it?"
    "1:22:30": "LOstTGM Q: What happens with the particles' (more simplified) collision detection if you at the same time hold and drag the window's title bar, since the game timer will be paused when the window is in the drag / size message loop built into Windows?"
    "1:24:32": "Dragonmaster047 Q: How would you \"abstract\" a math library as in, the game / engine uses a v2 / v3 / v4 class and you have to use graphics libs with predefined vector classes they use for rendering but you don't want to couple your game with one of these libs?"
    "1:25:27": "Close down"

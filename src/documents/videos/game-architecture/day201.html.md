    "1:05:25": "insofaras Q: Now that the amount of debug code is getting larger, will you create a debug debug system to debug the debug code?"
    "1:06:04": "Manicthenobody Q: Is this the link you were looking for earlier for MartinCohen? [see Resources]"
    "1:07:07": "garryjohanson Q: What do you think about the use of pre-fetch cache instructions? Are they a viable option for general purpose programming to get maximum performance?"
    "1:08:28": "Connor_Rentz Q: After the two year period, will we be able to mod the game?"
    "1:08:37": "CaptainKraft Q: Does the architecture of your target system have a big effect on how you design your debug system?"
    "1:09:51": "Kelimion Q: Would be it an idea to pass build.bat a parameter which you would use to switch optimisation on and off on the different build units? Like IF %1 == opt, do this, otherwise do that"
    "1:10:29": "vivek12895 Q: What do you think about \"No Man's Sky\"? I can't even think about how it works now. Will I get some idea after learning from you?"
    "1:11:28": "Connor_Rentz Q: I mean, after you release the source code. Will we be able to create our own bosses, worlds, etc.?"
    "1:11:48": "Stiegosaurus Q: Will you be returning to game specific coding soon?"
    "1:13:41": "CaptainKraft Q: Could something like a Raspberry Pi or other ARM desktop PC run Handmade Hero well enough, and is that the kind of system where you would want to do the debugging on a separate machine?"
    "1:14:47": "Kelimion Q: I meant for usage inside the game, so you could switch optimisation on and off from the debug menu"
    "1:15:26": "garryjohanson Q: Do you think it would be totz baller to make a GUI visual language for game scripting like what Unreal has?"
    "1:16:14": "Blackboard: Visual Scripting"
    "1:18:35": "quartertron Q: Couldn't you collate just the last frame every frame instead of doing all of them in chunks?"
    "1:20:22": "Close this down"

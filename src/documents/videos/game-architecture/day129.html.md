    "1:03:00": "garlandobloom Q: Can you briefly go over the rest of what we're going to do to the engine before we start implementing gameplay code?"
    "1:04:22": "This will all be very game-codey (!quote 108)"
    "1:05:52": "dmitsuki Q: Right now to get more performance out of the render you multithread it to render the screen in chunks. GPUs are parallel by design so how do these two concepts differ?"
    "1:06:28": "Blackboard: Tiled vs Non-tiled GPUs"
    "1:10:00": "cfusion Q: If there are no better questions, wouldn't the solution to internally link objects in an arbitrary amount of linked lists be performance problematic? Or is there a smart solution I am missing here?"
    "1:10:43": "ofx360 Q: I feel like the GroundChunks move faster than the trees on the same plane"
    "1:11:04": "avenger36 Q: The gaming industry is too hard to enter. Why do potential programmers waste their time?"
    "1:11:32": "kededro Q: There's a lot of mug action going on. Are you one of those coffee-blooded programmers?"
    "1:11:46": "mvpatski Q: I am about to commence studying a degree in Computer Science. I love gaming, and the concept of creating them is fairly interesting, though I am not entirely mathematically inclined. This being the case, would you suggest I stay away from Game Development and steer toward my original plan of Software Engineering?"
    "1:12:32": "malavbhavsar Q: I have Ruby and JS background and I was wondering if you normally do unit testing / behavioral testing in game development, or is it just too hard because of visual elements?"
    "1:13:41": "darkrizen_tv Q: On your site you responded to the question, \"Why are you doing this project?\" with: \"Game programmers need to start creating high-quality teaching materials for their trade.\" How much progress have you made towards developing the twitch VODs into high-quality teaching materials?"
    "1:14:24": "robrobby Q: Do we know how many ms per frame we have right now for the game logic? So far we push 60 FPS but it's hard-locked and maybe we already have some room for game logic?"
    "1:15:20": "marumoto Q: Will everything be programatically animated or will it be done by an artist? Or both?"
    "1:15:31": "sicknastybra Q: Do you have a YouTube channel?"
    "1:15:53": "darkrizen_tv Q: Can you show a snippet where you implemented a hash table?"
    "1:17:23": "dmitsuki Q: If Vulkan is out by the time you hardware accelerate the renderer, would it be possible to use Vulkan?"
    "1:17:42": "avenger36 Q: Why do you think Microsoft decided to omit the 1080i resolution option for the XBox One? Do you think it was too difficult for them to include?"
    "1:17:58": "noxy_key Q: Do you plan on commenting the code before releasing the engine?"
    "1:19:24": "robrobby Q: It's just insane that we can have so many laggy games today when CPUs / GPUs are that fast...  Thank you for bringing some light into the reasons for that (bad programming and/or languages)"
    "1:22:59": "kededro Q: Is unsafe memory key for high-performance optimizations needed for modern-day games? I've heard this is the key reason memory-safe languages like Rust and Haskell won't be able to take over for extremely low-latency applications or drivers, but I don't know enough about the domain"
    "1:25:41": "Shut things down"

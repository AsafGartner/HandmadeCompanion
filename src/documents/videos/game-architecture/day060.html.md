    "56:17": "Q: Isn't making a struct for HP is preprogramming a little?"
    "57:48": "Q: Why not just use HitPointMax = 12 instead of dividing into 3 hearts and 4 segments?"
    "58:24": "Q: I noticed the floating head was always behind the player. Are you going to go for a depth buffer approach or draw back-to-front to handle this?"
    "1:07:36": "Q: Would it be entirely possible to completely reconstruct the current code by following every episode of the series without preordering the game?"
    "1:08:08": "Q: Do you think that I, as a totally new person of programming, would be able to follow along with the pace you are working at, doing rapid changes to the code without sometimes telling us why?"
    "1:09:11": "Q: Is there ever gonna be a moment of reflection at some point in the future where you provide a somewhat high level overview of the engine components we have been encountered so far, what they will provide and why we need them?"
    "1:10:34": "Q: I think it would be really cool if you implement a smooth scrolling room-based combination"
    "1:11:19": "Q: Is the translucent thing you were talking about hard to do on 2D UI? Do you write the UI in the same Z-buffer or is it separate?"
    "1:12:51": "Q: Will you be implementing more memory handling code and, if yes, what kind of things?"
    "1:14:58": "Q: If you do a bounding box, which is an inset X amount of meters / tiles from the room edge, you could use the collision of the player with the bounding box to start smooth scrolling to the next room, etc."
    "1:15:36": "Q: How will we be handling resolution variance?"
    "1:16:41": "Q: What kind of error handling / logging do you have in place now, and how will that possibly change?"
    "1:17:35": "Q: Why are strings such a problem for so many engines?"
    "1:17:45": "Q: How hard is it to port a 32-bit game engine to compile a 64-bit output client if the origin game splits executables to surpass the 4-gig cap?"
    "1:18:30": "Q: Zelda had scrolling when you transition between rooms. Are you going to have something similar?"
    "1:18:47": "Q: Would you mind giving a brief walkthrough of the memory management going on right now in the code from the game boot and forward?"
    "1:22:21": "Q: Why is it impossible to resize a raster image and why does everything have to be rasterized for drawing? Why can't textures be vector-based?"
    "1:24:51": "Q: Couldn't we build handmade.cpp and win32_handmade.cpp in separate threads? Is there a way to pipe the error messages in a sane way using the build.bat approach?"
    "1:25:57": "Q: SWTOR does it (about 32-bit splits into 2 separate processes question)"
    "1:26:54": "Q: Binding of Isaac does have scrolling between rooms, albeit a very quick transition"
    "1:27:37": "Q: What is the drawing app we are using?"
    "1:28:13": "Internet: Check out the scrolling in The Binding of Isaac"
    "1:29:54": "We've finish up on the stream"
    "1:29:59": "Save our giant drawing in Mischief"

    "57:48": "Q: Why not just use HitPointMax = 12 instead of dividing into 3 hearts and 4 segments"
    "58:24": "Q: I know this floating head is always behind the player. Are you going to go for a depth buffer approach or draw back to front to handle this?"
    "1:07:36": "Q: Would it be entirely possible to completely reconstruct current code by following every episode in series without preordering the game?"
    "1:08:08": "Q: Do you think that I as a totally new person of program would be able to follow along with a pase you are working at? Doing rapid changes to the code without sometimes telling us why"
    "1:09:11": "Q: Is there ever gonna be a moment of reflection at some point in the future will you provide some high level overview of engine components we have been encountered so far? what will they provide and why we need them?"
    "1:10:34": "Q: I think it would be really cool if you implement smooth scrolling room based combination."
    "1:11:19": "Q: Is the transition thing you are talking about hard to do on 2D UI? Do you write the UI in same Z-Buffer or is it seperate?"
    "1:12:51": "Q: Will you be implement more memory handling code and if yes what kind of things?"
    "1:14:58": "Q: If you do a bounding box, which is an insetted X amount of meters/tiles from the room edge, you can use to collision of the player with the bounding box to start smooth scrolling to the next room, etc."
    "1:15:36": "Q: How long will we be handling resolution variance?"
    "1:16:41": "Q: What kind of error handling/logging do you have in place now and how will that possibly change?
    "1:17:35": "Q: Why are streams such a problem for so many engines?"
    "1:17:45": "Q: How hard is to port a 32-bit game engine to compile 64-bit output client if the origin game splits executable to suppress the 4 giga cap?"
    "1:18:30": "Q: Zelda has scrolling when you're transition between rooms. Are you going to have some similar?"
    "1:18:47": "Q: Would you mind giving a brief walkthrough of memory management going on right now in the game from the game boot and forward?"
    "1:22:21": "Q: Why is it impossible to resize a raster image and why does everything has to be raterize for drawing? why can texture be vector-based?"
    "1:24:51": "Q: Couldn't we build handmade.cpp and win32_handmade.cpp in separate thread? Is there a way to pipe the error messages in the same way using the build.bat approach?"
    "1:25:57": "Q: SWTOR does it. (about 32-bit splits into 2 separate processes quetion)"
    "1:26:54": "Q: Binding of issac does have scrolling between rooms of being a very quick transition. (about smooth scrolling quetion)"
    "1:26:54": "Q: What is the drawing app we are using?"
    "1:29:54": "We've finish up on the stream"
    "1:29:59": "Save our giant drawing in Mischief"

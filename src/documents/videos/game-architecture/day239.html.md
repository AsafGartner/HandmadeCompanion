    "1:00:34": "TheSizik Q: Did you notice that the ground tiles changed when you introduced sorting?"
    "1:01:18": "Mr4thDimention Q: I've asked this before, but I want to hear your case again, what specific things make a data-protocol based interface better than one with function calls?"
    "1:05:48": "Robrobby Q: How is V-Sync controlled?"
    "1:06:21": "cubercaleb Q: Does the GPU do sRGB correction automatically?"
    "1:07:40": "Pseudonym73 Q: I wasn't paying close attention, but has the OpenGL texture name thing broken hot-reloading?"
    "1:08:11": "FlightSwifty Q: What languages do you know"
    "1:08:17": "elxenoaizd Q: Are there any performance reasons to choose compatible OpenGL API vs Core, or is it just the fact that we get to use programmable shaders in Core?"
    "1:10:15": "Evine Q: Is there any good reason for desktop GPUs to not have programmable blend modes? Because I've seen that most mobile GPUs have that"
    "1:10:51": "Blackboard: Tiled (mobile) vs Non-tiled (desktop) Framebuffer"
    "1:17:26": "ttbjm Q: Do we get gamma correct rendering \"for free\" now?"
    "1:17:56": "cubercaleb Q: Doesn't the OS automatically V-Sync you, or does that only apply in windowed mode?"
    "1:18:13": "Robrobby Q: So gamma curve is also a OpenGL extension?"
    "1:18:20": "Longboolean Q: I know you're probobly sick of all the Vulkan questions, but here is another one. A lot of places online frame Vulkan as the next version of OpenGL, their thought being that once Vulkan is released development / adoption of OpenGL will dwindle to the point where OpenGL drivers are no longer developed by graphics card manufacturers. Could this happen? And in the event that it does, what is your plan?"
    "1:20:26": "BradSheridanMN Q: You stated that the APIs are very similar, but is there a visual effect that can be accomplished on DirectX and not on OpenGL or vice versa?"
    "1:21:00": "andsz_ Q: Is there a good reason why windows OpenGL headers only offer the old legacy stuff while other platforms add new stuff?"
    "1:21:53": "cubercaleb Q: At some point can you go over the pros and cons of the different graphics APIs?"
    "1:25:01": "Call it a day"

## Quotes

* 357\. We're going to leave it as a little bit of a zygote for the moment (11:29)
* 358\. Okay... someone want to tell me how THAT just happened? (12:54)
* 359\. It's almost like the hardware is set up to do this! Parentheses: it is (33:23)
* 360\. DirectX doesn't run anywhere, Windows is the only place you can use it, or maybe if you're an Xbox developer, if those even exist anymore (56:12)

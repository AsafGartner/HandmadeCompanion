    "1:09:39": "cynokron Q: For the stairs have you considered stairs on a particular floor go down instead of up, then you wouldn't have to worry about alpha?"
    "1:10:50": "thesizik Q: So instead of the above floor perspective-transforming into place as you move up the stairs, it stays still and jump-cuts to the proper perspective once you hop to a tile in that floor"
    "1:12:02": "Amusing ancdote from the Papers We Love conference"
    "1:13:11": "williambundy Q: Are you doing a whole layer transform at once, or per object?"
    "1:13:24": "cynokron Q: Yes, but currently stairs are owned by the floor below them. If they are owned by the floor above them then you wouldn't see the stairs two floors above, since they would be two floors above (thus not blocking your way and not needing any alpha)"
    "1:14:03": "pseudonym73 Q: Now I'm curious if Casey speaks faster or slower than Buckminster Fuller did"
    "1:14:29": "Go ahead and close it down"

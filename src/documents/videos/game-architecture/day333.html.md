    "1:01:07": "cyberpunkhobo Q: Are there any particular reasons not to prefer continuous scaling in Z besides easing sorting?"
    "1:01:37": "Blackboard: Avoiding perspective transform for the scenery"
    "1:04:44": "soysaucethekid Q: I may have missed it, but what's the reasoning for typedef'ing a b32x as a b32 and not just use b32?"
    "1:07:10": "thesizik Q: Thought: Have the floor above transform with the Y-displacement respective to the current floor, until you jump over to it, at which point the view cuts to be relative to the now-current floor"
    "1:07:57": "dmitsuki Q: I just watched your Papers talk and I didn't get the Minkowski sum exactly. I don't get where you deduce the points to subtract from each other"
    "1:08:54": "dmitsuki Q: Did you explain it on stream before? If so I can go to the archives [see Resources, Molly Rocket]"
    "1:09:39": "cynokron Q: For the stairs have you considered stairs on a particular floor go down instead of up, then you wouldn't have to worry about alpha?"
    "1:10:50": "thesizik Q: So instead of the above floor perspective-transforming into place as you move up the stairs, it stays still and jump-cuts to the proper perspective once you hop to a tile in that floor"
    "1:12:02": "Amusing ancdote from the Papers We Love conference"
    "1:13:11": "williambundy Q: Are you doing a whole layer transform at once, or per object?"
    "1:13:24": "cynokron Q: Yes, but currently stairs are owned by the floor below them. If they are owned by the floor above them then you wouldn't see the stairs two floors above, since they would be two floors above (thus not blocking your way and not needing any alpha)"
    "1:14:03": "pseudonym73 Q: Now I'm curious if Casey speaks faster or slower than Buckminster Fuller did"
    "1:14:29": "Go ahead and close it down"

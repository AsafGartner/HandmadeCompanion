    "1:05:19": "shinny_magikarp Q: How is the familiar intended to attack? Some kind of projectile or doing some kind of glide move and physically hitting a foe?"
    "1:06:41": "billdstrong Q: Will there be a boot to match the glove?"
    "1:06:47": "erdomina Q: For the particle effects for the glove, are we going to be doing something similar to what we did earlier using head assets?"
    "1:07:48": "Miblo Q: I'm wondering if it could be a cool mechanic if you could swipe and change your facing direction while you swipe, thus prolonging the swipe into a potentially never ending spinning punch..."
    "1:08:42": "sssmcgrath Q: Have you played Planescape: Torment? Handmade Hero totally needs a Morte-style familiar"
    "1:09:24": "wellingguzman Q: Will attacking be interrupt? Such as attacking unanimated entity, or someone attacked the player from behind and it jump opposite to the attack (e.g. old Zelda)?"
    "1:10:45": "duroate Q: Why not leave the glove swipe to the artist / animator of the game?"

    "1:03:12": "Is there an advantage of making the size of the LowEntity and HighEntity arrays a power of two?"
    "1:04:22": "This is a third-person game right?"
    "1:04:34": "What process would you have gone through for creating the controls and movement if this were a 2D side-scrolling platformer?"
    "1:05:28": "Do you feel today will be rewritten during optimization?"
    "1:06:40": "I don’t know if it’s been answered before but did you consider large fixed point integers for both entity types like Tom Forsythe seems to prefer instead of the swap between the floating point and the high frequency entities?"
    "1:08:58": "Wouldn’t be easier to keep a list of empty entity slots to add them there instead of always moving and changing one of the pointers?"
    "1:09:51": "Are you familiar with slot maps for game object storage and do you think you’d use them for this project? We use them for our engine."
    "1:11:22": "Any thoughts on controls for HH on controllerless touch screen devices like tablets?"
    "1:12:27": "(follow-up) I think a slot map is just an implementation of handles doubly indirect referenced through a table."
    "1:12:57": "Will Handmade Hero always be 20 scale feet tall?"
    "1:13:06": "What are you drinking?"
    "1:13:16": "(follow-up) What I call a slot map is an array that can have arbitrary empty slots and each slot has a version number for self-validation."
    "1:15:20": "End"

    "54:16": "elxenoaizd Q: There's an alternative way to start / end the counter instead of using constructor / destructor pair, and you don't have to store the data in the struct. Maybe not as convenient but it's worth mentioning. I use it quite often when I have to 'begin X' -- write code -- 'end X'. It's basically a hacked / tweaked version of C#'s 'using' statement. I think you'll find it interesting"

    "1:05:47": "elxenoaizd Q: I'm not sure I fully understand Unity builds. So Unity build is when we compile everything to a single file? I don't think that's the case because we do have multiple source files in HMH..."

    "1:08:18": "elxenoaizd Q: If exceptions are bad, then what is a good way to handle errors? Just return error codes? A global error value like in errno or GetLastError()? What do you think of the idea of having a central error handling function that we call and pass it the error id and it acts accordingly (switch statement maybe)? (!quote 209)"

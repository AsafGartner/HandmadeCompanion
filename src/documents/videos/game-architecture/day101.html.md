    "1:03:26": "mr4thdimention Q: All of the steps in elimination can be represented as a matrix. Starting with M and multiply by all those matrices you get the identity. So those matrices multiplied together are the inverse. Multiplying them all by the identity gives you the inverse. Is that the trick you are alluding to?"
    "1:07:47": "robotchocolatedino Q: To find the inverse matrix couldn't we just rotate by the negative angle and scale by 1 over the amount that we scaled by originally?"
    "1:17:32": "oliholli Q: I remember doing this by putting the identity besides the original matrix and performing each step to each"
    "1:21:24": "ufphen Q: If you had a matrix such as int[2][2] with the example of abcd as the variables in place, couldn't you just swap a and d and make c and b negative?"
    "1:22:31": "miblo Q: I understood none of today's episode. Would you recommend that I rewatch it, or do you think all may become clear tomorrow?"
    "1:23:31": "naysayer88 Q: If you write A and then I next to each other, and apply a bunch of operations, you are computing T3T2T1 A and T3T2T1 I. Because you ended up at the identity, T3T2T1A = I. So T3T2T1 = A^-1. Therefore T3T2T1 I = A^-1"

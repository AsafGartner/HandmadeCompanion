    "56:36": "Q&A"
    "57:00": "insofaras Q: Are the events keeping the same colors across frames? The long one looks like it keeps changing"
    "57:32": "handmade_debug.cpp: Make the colors persist across frames"
    "1:00:04": "handmade_debug.h: Add ColorIndex to debug_frame_region"
    "1:01:48": "elxenoaizd Q: Does the 0.5 pixel error in yesterday's stream matter a lot? I mean, it seemed a pretty easy thing to overlook. Would it make some calculations erroneous?"
    "1:02:41": "SoysauceTheKid Q: Why are there blank gaps on some of the bars? And why are the collated frames not flush with the other lines?"
    "1:03:13": "elxenoaizd Q: Is there a reason why we have many different starting points for coordinate systems (center vs top-left vs top-right corners; windows vs Direct3D vs OpenGL)? Wouldn't our lives be easier if there was a standard for them?"
    "1:04:09": "ChronalDragon Q: With handling sorting here, will we finally handle sorting of the other sprites in the game? Or will we just push that off further?"
    "1:04:26": "elxenoaizd Q: Why do we have both bool32 and int32?"
    "1:04:41": "JamesWidman Q: Pretty cool! It does seem like a lot of calls take very different amounts of time even though they're probably not doing anything different. Is that due to other active processes? Is it usually worthwhile to try to get more consistent timings?"
    "1:05:05": "elxenoaizd Q: How 'valuable' do you think C++ operator overloading actually is? I'm thinking of fully moving to just pure C. Do you think it would be inconvenient / a hassle to program without them? (Vector operations, etc.)"
    "1:05:40": "cubercaleb Q: Will you show us how to do hit detection for obscure shapes that may or may not exist in the debug UI?"
    "1:06:07": "RacerNA Q: Have you seen the UE4 GDC Trailer and what are your opinions on it? I understand we are all indies, but just in general, from a player standpoint"
    "1:06:34": "SoysauceTheKid Q: The longer bars (which I assumed was when the collation was happening) are farther left on the screen, than the shorter bars"
    "1:07:10": "cubercaleb Q: By obscure shapes, I mean a slice in a pie-chart [see Resources, Darel Rex Finley]"
    "1:09:10": "SoysauceTheKid Q: Yes"
    "1:11:04": "RacerNA Q: Yes the graphics. Check it out whenever [see Resources, YouTube]"
    "1:12:47": "JamesWidman Q: [re functions taking different amounts of time] I mean, if we don't send any input and essentially the same image keeps getting rendered repeatedly, we still see a lot of fluctuation in the amount of time being consumed per frame. We have a lot of chop where I would have expected relatively calm waters (unless we're losing time to other processes on the machine)"
    "1:15:12": "garryjohanson Q: Curious what point represents the amount of time it takes the operating system to set up the parallelism, if parallelism is the right word"
    "1:16:26": "cubercaleb Q: Do you know why one of the worker threads started after the others?"
    "1:17:16": "AlephAnt Q: Every once in a while it seems like a frame gets missed; I've noticed that happens in things I do as well. Is there a way to get around that reliably?"
    "1:18:36": "elxenoaizd Q: What do you think of the theory that says we already know everything, all the knowledge there is, but we just don't remember it? So when we study, etc. we start remembering things..."
    "1:20:17": "Announce an announcement and sign off"

    "57:16": "Boorocks998 Q: What keyboard layout do you use?"
    "57:27": "cubercaleb Q: Will handmade_opengl.cpp be included in the platform layer or game layer?"
    "59:09": "elxenoaizd Q: Jumped in a bit late, so are we using the fixed-function OpenGL API right now, or will we write our own matrix struct at some point?"
    "59:52": "ozmethod Q: Wrist braces - recommended for programmers in general, or just something you've had issues with?"
    "1:00:07": "cubercaleb Q: If you include handmade_opengl.cpp in the game layer, won't that force you to include windows.h and all the OpenGL headers in the game layer?"
    "1:01:41": "grizzlyninja_ Q: Was push buffer rendering primarily in the software renderer because the real hardware renderer works that way due to GPUs?"
    "1:02:16": "Pix1234 Q: Will the game be given away to dev viewers for free?"
    "1:02:41": "elxenoaizd Q: Off-topic: Have you worked with, talked to or met Andre Lamothe before?"
    "1:03:06": "LOstTGM Q: I feel uncomfortable with floating points representing pixels. Have you ever had problems with OpenGL and floating point values, like passing them to shaders, or texture coordinates?"
    "1:05:25": "AdiAdiABXze Q: Do you use any EBO (element buffer object) or VBO (vertex buffer object) in your OpenGL code? If no, why?"
    "1:08:35": "LOstTGM Q: Did you do your own glOrtho call when you set up the projection matrix? Also, thanks for all the matrix explanations"

## Quotes

* 355\. If you've been paying attention to our maths, and you know maths - the plural, of course, coming from the Britain... (25:47)
* 356\. Oh well, life is hard. But a small price to pay to access all the power of the GPU so, you know, who cares? (32:27)

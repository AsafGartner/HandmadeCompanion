    "1:21:05": "Why is the heros head 1.5 meters in diameter?"
    "1:21:29": "How would you handle concave objects with Minkowski?"
    "1:22:41": "Why isn't the game split up in smaller, more modular files?"
    "1:24:51": "Is the alpha channel in the art assets created by the artist?"
    "1:25:21": "How many years since you started doing games?"
    "1:26:37": "I usually just hope the framerate stays high enough for the velocity not to get too high"
    "1:28:57": "Can't you have multiple views of the same file with emacs?"
    "1:29:26": "Will you be able to use minkowski with rotating and diagonal objects?"
    "1:33:30": "How long have you been working on this game?"
    "1:33:57": "Is it possible to make an assert that lets you continue on failure?"
    "1:34:17": "Are you doing any cyclomatic complexity analysis?"
    "1:34:43": "How would you represent a large sidescroller 2D world?"
    "1:35:43": "Is it possible to determine the point of collision?"
    "1:36:11": "Seems like the inability to represent convex objects is a major for problem for physics"
    "1:37:15": "I meant determining the point of collision with the general GJK algorithm"
    "1:38:27": "Are we doing a Raspberry Pi port just for the heck of it?"
    "1:39:24": "Cyclomatic complexity: a direct measure of the number of linearly independent paths through the code"
    "1:39:50": "BeagleBone black is better than Raspberry Pi I think"
    "1:41:01": "Can't you do straight on hardware on the PC?"

    "1:00:40": "Q&A"
    "1:01:23": "Why use real physics and not something custom you can handtune?"
    "1:06:59": "Why not add an opposite directional deceleration when collisions occur?"
    "1:07:29": "Are you concerned that actual physics will retract from the beauty and elegance of the worlds greatest jump code?"
    "1:08:06": "What would you need to store if you wanted to rewind time ala Braid?"
    "1:12:53": "Is the character a bitmap?"
    "1:13:22": "Are we going to normalise the vector from the input, instead of having a special case for diagonals?"
    "1:14:01": "Will there be a map function to help determine terrain for friction and collisions?"
    "1:14:37": "Why v2 instead of vec2 or vector2?"
    "1:15:13": "Why not break the code into smaller functions?"
    "1:16:36": "Shouldn't you use a max speed variable?"
    "1:17:32": "Someone: Friction negative acceleration based on current velocity would feel better"
    "1:18:06": "Can you derive the 1/2at^2 part of the position equation again?"
    "1:23:54": "Do you think something like bullet or box2d for player movement is appropriate?"
    "1:25:38": "When would you use other integration methods?"
    "1:34:20": "Will we use rigid body even after the hero is bouncy and all that?"
    "1:35:00": "Correction on question from someone"
    "1:35:49": "If we had terrain (ice or mud), we could have an easy convincing example"

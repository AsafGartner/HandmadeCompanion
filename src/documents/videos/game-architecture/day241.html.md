    "1:09:46": "macielda Q: Your maximum frame time is about 2-3ms without VSync enabled, but with it enabled I see it stays at 16ms most of the time, but sometimes goes to 17ms. Does that mean it will skip a frame? Is that a problem with VSync?"
    "1:10:16": "Blackboard: SwapBuffers"
    "1:15:08": "jd96x Q: Is object oriented programming bad in general or for game purposes, and why?"
    "1:15:15": "rohit_n Q: I believe you do an strstr of GL_EXTENSIONS, then check if the end of the extension is null, a space or tab to see if it exists"
    "1:15:34": "SoysauceTheKid Q: Is there any reason to make the swap interval larger than 1?"
    "1:15:54": "Blackboard: Swap interval"
    "1:16:33": "m1el Q: Is there an asynchronous way to do VSync? I mean, a way to \"ask\" OpenGL if it has displayed the frame or how much time you have to wait until the frame is going to be displayed"
    "1:17:20": "ezioauditorerevs Q: How would you allow the game to run at a non-60 FPS rate and not speed up / slow down the animation speed?"
    "1:17:55": "elxenoaizd Q: Apologies if you explained this before. Since rotation is stored in the upper 3x3 part of the transform matrix, and Scale is stored in the 0,0, 1,1, 2,2 diagonal, how do the play well together? I mean, wouldn't changing the rotation or scale affect the other?"
    "1:18:18": "QuikliGames Q: You mentioned 120hz. How do you handle skipping every other VSync event? Do you just detect the monitor refresh rate and if 120hz swap twice in a row?"
    "1:18:41": "Connor_Rentz Q: If VSync is disabled in windows, will there be no VSync at all?"
    "1:18:59": "ezioauditorerevs Q: The glove in the scene where Krampus is giving it to the kid looks a bit strange with the thumb pointing downwards"
    "1:19:07": "Longboolean Q: Why does VSync cause input lag on some machines?"

    "1:20:44": "garlandobloom Q: What is that bottle full of that Jon posted on twitter?"
    "1:20:54": "Miblo Q: We're still fading from / to the desktop. Did you have to reimplement that? Is it being hardware rendered? Is the fade here to stay?"
    "1:21:20": "stasrgba Q: With WglSwapInterval() do we still have to do Sleep at the end of the frame? Could you also comment on glFinish / glFlush and how they're used?"
    "1:24:00": "insofaras Q: Will you use EXT_swap_tear? (-1 in the SwapInterval call)"
    "1:24:07": "macielda Q: Should we wait after SwapBuffers if it returns too fast?"
    "1:24:27": "Colt_Zero Q: Would it be better to minimize or maximize how much you do per frame? Like, would it be better to make your program take any time that it would be waiting for VSync, and instead focus it on performing more computations, even potentially computing things ahead of time?"
    "1:25:24": "Tybereon Q: How do you easily detect if VSync is active?"
    "1:25:51": "macielda Q: How do I VSync and prevent tearing with a dual-monitor setup? Is it any different than a single-monitor setup? [see Resources]"

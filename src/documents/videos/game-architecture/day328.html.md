    "1:05:39": "neres909 Q: I posted my question twice on pre-stream but both times it wasn't adressed. I experienced a bit of lag back then so I checked on archive what's up and it wasn't there. Am I doing something wrong?"
    "1:06:31": "hayai Q: A few people in the twitch chat are asking about what level of math do you think is required to be an effective programmer"
    "1:08:26": "internal_static_void Q: Casey, I understand that you are replacing all the string header functions (strlen, etc.). Are you not worried about optimization for these new functions you plan to write?"
    "1:09:14": "tiferet418 Q: I'm just trying to learn how to code. I'm following Stroustrup's book and he insists on teaching using math. All the good beginner books tend to assume math knowledge"
    "1:12:27": "neres909 Q: And again. Just let me know if you see it [see Resources, Handmade.Network]"
    "1:14:26": "neres909 Q: Hey. In one year I'm graduating and it will be time to find a job. All I always wanted was to work in the game industry but I have no work experience or projects that I am proud of to show as my portfolio. I guess you were leading programmer in your projects and you were responsible for making decision who to hire"
    "1:15:52": "neres909 Q: How you see people like me in this decision? Should I take whichever offer as a programmer I could find which might not even be connected with games, or maybe try to make the best game I can do in one year, or save some money and do an internship without salary (I didn't see any studios with a paid one in my region)? What's your opinion? [see Resources: Molly Rocket]"
    "1:27:46": "neres909 Q: Thank you for the in-depth explanation! I have one more Q: Since you're going on a break, can you trash out OOP just a bit so we don't get confused in the time you're not there, and stick to beloved compression oriented programming"
    "1:29:12": "Wrap it up"

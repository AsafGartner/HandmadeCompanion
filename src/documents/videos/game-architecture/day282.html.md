    "58:24": "Q&A"
    "59:04": "Miblo Q: That up / down camera movement looks so cool. I do hope the terrain height of the rooms makes good use of this"
    "59:42": "insofaras Q: Could you do something with GL_MIN / GL_MAX blend equation for the alpha?"
    "1:03:12": "deras007 Q: Can you create the word of warcraft game?"
    "1:04:19": "d7 Q: If the contour of your entities wasn't antialiased, you could have used the depth buffer and reverse the render order for the entities being faded (front to back), but alas, it is hard to do properly with the alpha blending around the contours"
    "1:05:50": "evraire Q: You mentioned rendering to an offscreen buffer then compositing as one means of getting the desired alpha effect, but you also mentioned something along the lines of using a \"fragment list\"? could you please elaborate a bit more on that approach?"
    "1:06:23": "Blackboard: Per-fragment atomic lists"
    "1:18:08": "cubercaleb Q: That sounds insane. Are there any modern games that use this?"
    "1:18:52": "quikligames Q: Could you just pre-render normally to an offscreen buffer, and then composite it with the primary frame buffer with the fade-out alpha?"
    "1:19:22": "d7 Q: If the antialiasing didn't throw a wrench, you could have used the depth-buffer-front-to-back rendering method all the way, and compensate for some of the extra bandwidth on less overdraw"
    "1:20:36": "cubercaleb Q: I mean that sounds like it has huge performance implications"
    "1:23:59": "sssmcgrath Q: Speaking of your smoke example, did you see what David Rosen posted today? [see Resources]"
    "1:24:58": "cosmiczord Q: I thought most games were only designed to max out console hardware?"
    "1:25:55": "Wrap it up"

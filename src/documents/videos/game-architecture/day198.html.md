    "1:07:00": "Q&A"
    "1:07:47": "Connor_Rentz Q: No questions"
    "1:08:04": "elxenoaizd Q: You mentioned that encapsulation is good but not in the OOP way. Could you elaborate then in which way you mean?"
    "1:09:09": "insofaras Q: Are the menu items spaced evenly vertically? Looks a bit odd to me"
    "1:09:25": "handmade_debug.cpp: Use LineAdvance to space the lines"
    "1:16:49": "adamantoise17 Q: Why is there so much lag / latency when dragging the hierarchies around? Or is that just Twitch streaming artifacts?"
    "1:18:08": "blah238 Q: Are the different tear-offs intended to have identical hierarchies or is the intention that you drill down into different things without all the tear-offs being affected?"
    "1:19:12": "APlethora Q: I noticed you use the internal keyword. I haven't seen it before. What is its purpose?"
    "1:19:23": "theGeekPirate Q: I apologize since I came in late, but out of curiosity, what was the tolerance (in pixels) you used for dragging out a subsection?"
    "1:19:38": "mojo123X Q: You mentioned that for linked lists at work you use metaprogramming. What did you mean?"
    "1:19:51": "Outcastedbird Q: I missed 90% of the stream, so I missed a ton. I just want to ask what are some tips for people who want to get into designing games? Dos and Don'ts and simple things that are worthwhile"
    "1:20:02": "APlethora Q: Does anyone know if there is plans in the future to add other platform support to this project?"
    "1:20:23": "elxenoaizd Q: Have you ever written anything for the PS1? (I think Jeff mentioned he used to do some stuff in a J&C episode?)"
    "1:20:27": "blah238 Q: Have you ever played any of the Space Quest games? The music for the video on the Handmade Hero site reminds me of it a lot"
    "1:20:47": "MartinCohen Q: Do you plan doing something with the character spacing in the text renderer?"
    "1:21:02": "Angrycrow Q: Is 'sentinel' a design pattern that will help with making the torn instances of the UI independent, or is that terminology that you've gained in years of tool development? Now that I understand what you meant by 'tearing' the interface, it seems really useful for isolating instances of hierarchies"
    "1:21:31": "Longboolean Q: Not a huge deal, but the labels no longer show if clicking them will expand or minimize them. Also at a glance it is not clear what is a category and what is a var"
    "1:21:48": "plain_flavored Q: Which game console had the worst SDK?"
    "1:22:16": "Wrap it up"

    "51:30": "poohshoes Q: In the MoveEntity function you have two variables that are never used: NewPlayerP and OldPlayerP. Will you delete them for me?"

    "56:15": "cdawzrd Q: if you wanted to see the lighting distort according to the spherical shape of the normal map, would that just be part of fixing the math in the section where you sample from the env map, or is there more to it?"
    "56:52": "grumpygiant256 Q: What are the benefits to having 3 top-middle-bottom EnvMaps vs just using 1 EnvMap for the whole thing?"
    "57:33": "Blackboard: Preview of how the EnvMaps will work"
    "59:48": "cdawzrd Q: I'm not sure I understand the point of the bottom map. Will the ground be contributing lighting to objects above the ground?"
    "1:01:24": "cdawzrd Q: Will you need a set of EnvMaps for each 'level' in Z?"
    "1:03:06": "grumpygiant256 Q: Any plans for doing over-brightening on the lights? (Or even HDR?)"
    "1:04:37": "starchypancakes Q: Could you contain all lighting information in a 5 byte bitmap: 0-255 Absorbance/reflectance scale for RGB, Alpha, and scattering? I want to try it but I feel really hesitant because you warned against non-32 bit aligned structs"
    "1:05:50": "grumpygiant256 Q: Even just using a 0-2 lighting range gets good results"
    "1:06:16": "cdawzrd Q: Do you plan on 'camera level' lighting effects such as 'stun grenade' for lack of a better example?"
    "1:06:55": "oliholli Q: If you can do without alpha, could you possibly use RGBE, where the E is the exponent for all channels?"

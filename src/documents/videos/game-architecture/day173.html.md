    "55:51": "Q&A"
    "57:01": "Miblo Q: The more I see the kerning in Notepad, compared to yours, the more awful it looks to me"
    "57:24": "Pseudonym73 Q: I realise that this is uncharted territory, but it seems to me that font rendering is taking more time than the rest of the renderer. Is that normal?"
    "1:00:29": "dmitsuki Q: Isn't Japanese evenly spaced?"
    "1:00:52": "abnercoimbre Q: Migraine :(. Glad to at least catch the Q&A"
    "1:01:09": "Robrobby Q: I was testing kerning in Notepad, Word, Wordpad... No kerning there? Where do you have seen kerning in Windows?"
    "1:01:26": "TheSizik Q: Don't forget the boilerplate"
    "1:01:32": "dmitsuki Q: John Carmack programmed low level graphics and got a Ferrari. Font rendering guy never got anything. When are we going to go back to programming cool superstar things?"
    "1:02:44": "NexMetu Q: I'm in my second year at uni for programming, and I still have problems getting my head around single things. My question is how long did it take you to have a good understanding of programming in general?"
    "1:03:11": "Pseudonym73 Q: Fair enough. Maybe it just seems like progress is slower for some definition of \"progress\""
    "1:03:42": "graeme7 Q: I'm confused why the font rendering relies so much on windows. Isn't all this stuff stored in the font files, or is that harder without Windows text metrics and such? Or, to put it another way, how would what we did today be different if we were using stb_truetype?"
    "1:04:18": "Robrobby Q: On the MSDN entry \"Uniscribe Glossary\" ABC Values is better explained how Windows understands it"
    "1:07:00": "Ignore the documentation and just do GetCharWidth32"
    "1:08:13": "See how that kerning looks"
    "1:10:10": "Danyguag Q: Do you use the graphics card at all when rendering?"
    "1:10:26": "Childz Q: I'm sure this has been answered so feel free to ignore if true. What are the features of C++ that you use that keep you from using just plain old C?"
    "1:10:52": "Robrobby Q: When you say Windows uses kerning, why is every letter never overlapping in the space of the followed letter? In your code I see the letters overlapping. Did I understand kerning wrong?"
    "1:11:36": "dmitsuki Q: O-oh yeah, well, John Carmack also got to make Rocketships, so he wins"
    "1:12:03": "cubercaleb Q: Are you saying Adobe has better programmers than Id?"
    "1:13:01": "dmitsuki Q: Why didn't we use bitmap fonts and used TTF? Bitmap fonts are cross platform, are they not?"
    "1:13:36": "GameDeve Q: When I render on a GPU, is there a way without copying the render result back to RAM?"
    "1:14:04": "jooda12 Q: Japanese isn't evenly spaced. Some characters like 「 and 」 rely on kerning"
    "1:14:57": "Danyguag Q: How do you render to the GPU?"
    "1:15:27": "guit4rfreak Q: Favorite font for reading?"
    "1:15:44": "GameDeve Q: To display the result"
    "1:16:34": "gasto5 Q: I almost got a headache when you said alignment is not the same as kerning, please expound"
    "1:16:51": "Blackboard: Spacing vs. Kerning"
    "1:20:14": "cubercaleb Q: Would you rather have a CPU with more cores than a GPU, or enough clock cycles to outperform the GPU with software rendering?"
    "1:20:32": "jooda12 Q: You can look here [see Resources, W3C], 3. Tsumegumi for Japanese kerning"
    "1:22:23": "Robrobby Q: When thinking Adobe has a market value of over 40billion, why no great programmer wants to do a better Photoshop?"
    "1:24:40": "dmitsuki Q: There are actually a lot of people competing with Photoshop, and you are using one of those products on stream right now..."
    "1:26:01": "Wind it down"

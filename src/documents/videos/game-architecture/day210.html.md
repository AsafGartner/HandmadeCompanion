    "1:06:57": "stiegosaurus Q: Handmade, I'm not sure if you specified this in a previous broadcast, but do you plan to implement side scrolling or any kind of platforming alongside the top-down view?"
    "1:07:54": "insobot Q: Llvm is getting too deep?"

    "1:08:43": "stiegosaurus Q: What has been your favourite thing so far writing this engine?"
    "1:09:08": "tyroie Q: I had an idea that's probably stupid. But I was wondering if a Vector that, when deleting an element, just left an empty spot that's skipped over when iterating, would still be cache friendly - and still efficient when deleting and inserting. This is slightly over my head though"

    "1:18:08": "mrbass21 Q: What role do you think software security has in modern gaming? Is it not worth wasting CPU cycles to guard against different exploits? How good of a job is the game industry doing in implementing it and should they be doing more or less?"

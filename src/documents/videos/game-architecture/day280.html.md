    "58:42": "Q&A"
    "1:00:25": "dustinten Q: Is there any real difference between #ifndef and #if !defined? I always use the first but I see you use the latter"
    "1:00:55": "dudeinbasement1 Q: Do you feel like we take steps backward when we get into code we haven't been in in a while, e.g. the problems with moving the screen?"
    "1:01:22": "grub_smub Q: Do you use a lot of header files?"
    "1:01:53": "Remove all instances of #if !defined"
    "1:06:07": "xgabrielxal Q: Why not #pragma once?"
    "1:08:56": "erdomina Q: Would you say the architecture of the entity system is based more on experience than on exploration?"
    "1:09:28": "dustinten Q: Do you have a plan for the \"components\" of the entities? Just use the flags like you are now?"
    "1:09:47": "longboolean Q: As a codebase grows new functions are created and others are no longer called anywhere. Are there any good ways that you recommend for finding out which functions / blocks of code are never used anywhere?"
    "1:11:29": "duroate Q: Is there a way to run the game \"entirely\" and find out what parts of your code aren't being used, to get rid of?"
    "1:13:02": "josianmarriott Q: The dynamite jack entity system is similar (but without compression)"
    "1:13:37": "ttbjm Q: Have you checked LOC recently?"
    "1:14:14": "Jim0_o Q: How is your arm now? Any chance of a streamathon?"
    "1:14:39": "dudeinbasement1 Q: CTime needs cloc built-in"
    "1:15:37": "J_vanRijn Q: Re code coverage, when Farbrausch was trying to cut down size of Kkrieger they wrote a quick code coverage tool called Lekktor and because someone didn't use a certain key in the menu, the code to handle it was left out in the released version"

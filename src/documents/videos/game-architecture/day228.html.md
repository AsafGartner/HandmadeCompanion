    "1:02:06": "serge_rgb Q: Could you tell us roughly how the expanding arena would be implemented?"
    "1:02:57": "insofaras Q: Is the lower level memory arena thing you mentioned for PC basically just what malloc / VirtualAlloc does?"
    "1:03:25": "SimonDenton Q: I got the K & R book to learn C. Any other useful resources? I take online stuff with a grain of salt"
    "1:03:36": "gasto5 Q: Is interlaced the same as interleaved?"
    "1:04:33": "Connor_Rentz Q: What should I do with my life while Handmade Hero is on break?"
    "1:05:06": "cubercaleb Q: Which algorithm do you plan on using for sorting?"
    "1:05:43": "elxenoaizd Q: Why are we running in a windows application (using WinMain) instead of a console one (using regular main(int, char**)), and still RegisterClass, CreateWindow, etc?"
    "1:06:35": "cubercaleb Q: Why was the interleaving added in the first place?"
    "1:07:01": "insofaras Q: How many TODOs are there in the code now?"
    "1:07:29": "pragmascrypt Q: Is there much overhead to spawning the renderthreads every frame instead of keeping them around"
    "1:07:45": "Culver_Fly Q: Do you always start with software rendering when working on games?"
    "1:08:27": "groggeh Q: For new years can we get a marathon?"
    "1:08:33": "RyanRies Q: Can you do really smooth animation in GDI, without vsync?"
    "1:09:16": "elxenoaizd Q: Simple question but how do you forward declare a struct in pure C? If I have \"typedef struct foo {...} foo;\". How do I forward declare this? I tried typedef struct foo foo; but it didn't work"
    "1:09:49": "m1el Q: Do you have any optimization for not blending transparent pixels?"
    "1:11:18": "cubercaleb Q: Once you have sorting implemented, do you think you will change the renderer to draw front to back?"
    "1:11:40": "elxenoaizd Q: Thanks, I was just curious in my console question. But sometimes I write utils that I would like to live in the background and not be visible on the screen, so I use a Windows application and hide the window. Is there any way to use a console instead and hide that (from taskmgr, etc.)?"
    "1:12:08": "actbinary Q: Can you give a quick overview of the way memory is managed at the moment? PushArena / BeginTempArena, etc?"
    "1:12:46": "Blackboard: Memory Arenas"
    "1:14:21": "Alfwich Q: Are you still using .bat file compilations?"
    "1:14:45": "Wrap it up"

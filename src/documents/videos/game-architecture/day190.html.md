    "1:01:40": "Miblo Q: I appreciate that there are more robust ways of implementing such things, but would it be practical to use the debug data to drive some of the game's visual effects, e.g. fire or, more likely, some otherworldly magical entity or the display on an in-game computer? Maybe it could be a sort of Easter Egg for those of us who know how the game's made"
    "1:02:45": "elxenoaizd Q: There are magenta spikes in the debug graph that happens so fast we don't have time to click on them. How do we plan to catch those? Having the ability to step-over frame-by-frame would be useful, methinks. Another idea is to have the debug text left off at the last rect position we hovered at"

    "1:04:15": "nxsy Q: I'm scared to look back at my own library reload (not even looped editing) after I stopped using it for a few months. Probably 10+ hours of debugging ahead of me"
    "1:04:52": "drchilitopicoso Q: Besides UI, what things must use threads in games? Just started learning threads and I'm curious. There are some things that somehow run slower threaded than single"
    "1:11:10": "drchilitopicoso Q: For the moment I have a thread job system. It's for rebuilding a mesh. For a big mesh it takes like 20 ms, so I thought maybe it would make it faster but not that much, maybe like 13% faster"

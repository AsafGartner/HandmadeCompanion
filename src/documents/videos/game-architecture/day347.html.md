    "52:39": "Q&A"
    "53:29": "thesizik Q: long is >= 32 bits, long long is >= 64 bits"
    "55:00": "pseudonym73 Q: Windows is LLP64, everything else is LP64. The only difference between the two is the size of long. Everything else (short, int, long long) is the same"
    "57:35": "zilarrezko Q: Is there any plan on organizing the episodes in a manner such as \"Worked on mandalas on these episodes\"? [see Resources, YouTube]"
    "59:49": "Miblo Q: We'll have \"category tagging\" in the new annotation system"
    "1:00:55": "doritosranger Q: Would Handmade Hero get a version for Linux or is it strictly a windows project? If it's true, why not using Linux in work? Is it personal choice or is it harder to debug something on windows?"
    "1:04:14": "dudeinbasement1 Q: Winners don't use drugs message needs to be added in the game's loading screen"
    "1:04:30": "zilarrezko Q: Seems like the questions aren't polling in... Do you usually put your rendering / updating / input processing in the same function like you have been doing?"
    "1:05:12": "edvinholm Q: Is the bending of the hero's body going to be like it is now? Looks a bit weird"
    "1:05:43": "samnchiet Q: On moving from Windows to Linux, how much of the onus of making this change lies on the consumers vs Linux OS \"designers\"? Linux distros aren't normally ordinary-user friendly"
    "1:06:31": "doritosranger Q: What do you think about free software (Stallman, FSF, GPL)?"
    "1:13:08": "Close it up"

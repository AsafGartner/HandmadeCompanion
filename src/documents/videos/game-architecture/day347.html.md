title: "Debugging Win32 Memory List Corruption"
videoId: "wuYRpxnE9R8"
markers:
    "0:09": "Recap and set the stage for the day"
    "1:49": "Run the game to demo the bug with the looped live code editing, and begin investigating it"
    "5:48": "win32_handmade.cpp: Walk through how PLATFORM_ALLOCATE_MEMORY(), PLATFORM_DEALLOCATE_MEMORY() and Win32FreeMemoryBlock() work"
    "11:35": "Step in to Win32FreeMemoryBlock() to gauge the rarity of this bug"
    "15:34": "win32_handmade.cpp: Introduce Win32VerifyMemoryListIntegrity()"
    "19:11": "win32_handmade.cpp: Make PLATFORM_ALLOCATE_MEMORY() call Win32VerifyMemoryListIntegrity() at the end and start, run and hit the one at the start"
    "24:59": "win32_handmade.cpp: Make Win32VerifyMemoryListIntegrity() increment a FailCounter, :run the game and locate the failure case"
    "28:40": "Step in to Win32VerifyMemoryListIntegrity() and identify who is getting written and when"
    "30:35": "Set a data breakpoint on the Size, run the game and see who touched that memory location"
    "35:58": "Look at where we set PushBufferBase, fix up RenderCommandsStruct() and correctly initialise the PushBuffer"
    "38:01": "Run the game and find that the bug is dead"
    "38:46": "win32_handmade.cpp: Remove the calls to Win32VerifyMemoryListIntegrity(), run the game and see that we're still okay"
    "40:16": "win32_handmade.cpp: Introduce Win32GetMemoryStats() in order to initialise arenas with debug information"
    "43:43": "handmade_platform.h: Introduce DEBUG_PLATFORM_GET_MEMORY_STATS()"
    "46:26": "handmade_debug.cpp: Enable DEBUGEnd() to print the memory stats"
    "49:28": "handmade_shared.h: Enable FormatStringList() to handle the l case"
    "51:12": "Run the game and consult the profiler"
    "52:39": "Q&A"
    "53:29": "thesizik Q: long is >= 32 bits, long long is >= 64 bits"
    "55:00": "pseudonym73 Q: Windows is LLP64, everything else is LP64. The only difference between the two is the size of long. Everything else (short, int, long long) is the same"
    "57:35": "zilarrezko Q: Is there any plan on organizing the episodes in a manner such as \"Worked on mandalas on these episodes\"? [see Resources, YouTube]"
    "59:49": "Miblo Q: We'll have \"category tagging\" in the new annotation system"
    "1:00:55": "doritosranger Q: Would Handmade Hero get a version for Linux or is it strictly a windows project? If it's true, why not using Linux in work? Is it personal choice or is it harder to debug something on windows?"
    "1:04:14": "dudeinbasement1 Q: Winners don't use drugs message needs to be added in the game's loading screen"
    "1:04:30": "zilarrezko Q: Seems like the questions aren't polling in... Do you usually put your rendering / updating / input processing in the same function like you have been doing?"
    "1:05:12": "edvinholm Q: Is the bending of the hero's body going to be like it is now? Looks a bit weird"
    "1:05:43": "samnchiet Q: On moving from Windows to Linux, how much of the onus of making this change lies on the consumers vs Linux OS \"designers\"? Linux distros aren't normally ordinary-user friendly"
    "1:06:31": "doritosranger Q: What do you think about free software (Stallman, FSF, GPL)?"
    "1:13:08": "Close it up"

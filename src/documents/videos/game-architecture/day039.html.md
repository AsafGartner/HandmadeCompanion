    "1:01:46": "Can you do that live code with a fucntion call? That could just be a poke. -Geneticspecies"
    "1:02:05": "Enumerations. Am I correct to say you've not used them in Handmade Hero yet? I'm guessing this is simply because it's to early to know what will eventually require enumerations and not some other reason."
    "1:02:38": "Why not layer the individual bodyparts into a single bitmap that way you only have to draw one image instead of three?"
    "1:03:20": "Are you wearing a blue cape like the Handmade Hero today?"
    "1:03:31": "I just wanted to point out that there is a magnifying tool in windows that came with aero"
    "1:05:09": "Don't you want to test the hotloading? -Andysz"
    "1:05:39": "HAHA YOU SWORE! -Garlandobloom"
    "1:06:07": "Can you add a <stddef.h> include to handmadehero.h?"
    "1:07:56": "Why does the guy have no feet?"
    "1:08:17": "How do you know which compiler options, like clr and standard headers, you want to use?
    "1:10:46": "Changing the literal value of a variable is a peak and poke technique. Poking a value to a memory address..."
    "1:13:23": "What will happen if you have an item that is infront in one view but in the back in another? Since it seems you have hard coded the order in which they are drawn, will you reorder them based on the view or on some other technique?"
    "1:14:50": "Why don't you use the emacs calc?"
    "1:15:25": "Comment on zoomin being at sysinternals.com"
    "1:16:34": "When you panned off the min edges can you explain how the head was redrawing over the body?"
    "1:22:02": "Do you ever write test or does the average game not have unit tests?"
    "1:23:34": "Does this form of live coding work with adding member variables to structs?"
    "1:24:24": "How does this test code help with the future architecture since it all gets dumped?"
    "1:26:05": "I'm not sure if this is true. I'm assuming you're making the guy clip when leaving the screen, but why make it clip if you can just make it follow the yellow box which might clip the guy itself. Again I really.."
    "1:26:35": "If streaming assets will be required to display all visual information will their be some type of manual limit placed on the procedural generation to ensure that all assets will never be required for a single room?"
    "1:27:00": "End Q&A and closing statements"

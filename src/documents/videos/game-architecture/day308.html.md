    "1:12:53": "roam00010011 Q: Off-topic: At the start of the show, you said that every game programmer uses a dev setup similar to what we use: debug with Visual Studio, but code with a different editor. Why?"
    "1:15:05": "filiadelski Q: Are you enjoying this project as a programming challenge or are your efforts mainly put into the teaching part of it?"
    "1:17:12": "melg1 Q: What do you think about unit testing and test driven development applied to C++ code? Is this technique really useful and worth trying?"
    "1:26:42": "roam00010011 Q: It's because you are the only programmer! When working in a team that will use your code, you need const"
    "1:29:24": "sssmcgrath Q: I programmed in 100% const correct for 5 years. Never again"
    "1:29:41": "Close it on out"

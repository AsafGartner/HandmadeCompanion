    "59:05": "insobot Q: I couldn't drop that into The Witness, then. FailFish Really. Kappa?"
    "59:26": "blah238 Q: It looks like the torso sprite occasionally draws on top of the head sprite, e.g. going up stairs"
    "1:00:01": "Blackboard: How the hero is constructed"
    "1:01:18": "roam00010011 Q: Does collision work between stairs and hero? Because body under and head above the stairs should not happen"
    "1:04:09": "bryanwwag Q: Do you anticipate similar (if not identical) graph sorting would be used for any other game purpose (other than sprite sort)?"
    "1:05:40": "thesgmastr Q: What language is this?"
    "1:06:40": "thesgmastr Q: What are a few pieces of advice you would give to a new programmer?"
    "1:09:05": "xendash Q: What is your estimate time it will take for you to finish Handmade Hero? And how different is it from the original estimate? (I assume you are about halfway)"
    "1:12:53": "roam00010011 Q: Off-topic: At the start of the show, you said that every game programmer uses a dev setup similar to what we use: debug with Visual Studio, but code with a different editor. Why?"
    "1:15:05": "filiadelski Q: Are you enjoying this project as a programming challenge or are your efforts mainly put into the teaching part of it?"
    "1:17:12": "melg1 Q: What do you think about unit testing and test driven development applied to C++ code? Is this technique really useful and worth trying?"
    "1:26:42": "roam00010011 Q: It's because you are the only programmer! When working in a team that will use your code, you need const"
    "1:29:24": "sssmcgrath Q: I programmed in 100% const correct for 5 years. Never again"
    "1:29:41": "Close it on out"

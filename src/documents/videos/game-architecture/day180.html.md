    "59:52": "Q&A"
    "1:01:41": "BrainCruser Q: Doesn't the multi-core rendering screw up your timing?"
    "1:02:37": "ifingerbangedurcat Q: Can you briefly explain how it tracks how long it takes the frame to work and the render engine to work if rendering the debug is part of that work? Also a suggestion, use a key to toggle the debug display to see the game"
    "1:05:52": "garlandobloom Q: Did you get 4coder set up?"
    "1:06:17": "ciutchism Q: Do you ever think it's amazing how 100s of designers can screw up a project by trying to be complex when indie designers can make a better game in a few months?"
    "1:09:38": "griggs3d07 Q: You mentioned that the way you draw rects is not optimized. What do you want to change?"
    "1:10:44": "Stephenlast Q: Because you're using rendering on multiple threads, is it saying that you're spending more cycles in DrawRectangle / DrawRectangleQuickly than GameUpdateAndRender?"
    "1:12:26": "Mojobojo Q: Why are you echoing to lock.tmp in your bat file?"
    "1:14:13": "jfcatalan Q: So after \"lib freedom week\" we could reasonably easily boot HH off something like baremetalOS and go all \"look 'ma no OS\" (minus sound I guess)?"
    "1:15:00": "inquarry Q: Will HH be optimized for GPUs or are you sticking to CPU render? Will that be an arduous task or pretty straight forward?"
    "1:15:32": "ciutchism Q: If I have a simple app concept that I can't code myself because I'm a scrub, is there any good way to get somebody to make an app for me that is somewhat simplistic and we split profits or even I just get 10%? I don't care about the profits I just want to help develop the app"
    "1:16:12": "SeargeDP Q: Why are you not using visual studio to write your code? It seems to be a windows machine you are working on"
    "1:16:51": "Close outta here"
    "1:17:25": "Announcement: GitHub private repository now available for those who preorder the source"

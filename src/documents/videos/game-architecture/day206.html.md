    "1:18:18": "hoganlong Q: Who is Jon and what language are you talking about?"
    "1:18:39": "cvaucher Q: I'm writing a parser that looks pretty similar to this, but it runs on multi-GB files which takes a while. Any common approaches to use SIMD/multithreading to speed up text parsing? Seems more difficult since the characters aren't \"independent\" in the way pixels are"
    "1:20:18": "desophos Q: This stream makes me feel like an extremely inferior and incompetent programmer. Do you approve of this?"
    "1:22:58": "paulsm1th Q: How does metaprogramming change your workflow? Can you talk about incorporating generated code with the \"regular\" C files?"

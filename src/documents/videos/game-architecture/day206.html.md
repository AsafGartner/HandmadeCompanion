    "1:02:52": "paulsm1th Q: It seems like you are doing recursive descent parsing. Is that how you would describe it?"

    "1:10:10": "garryjohanson Q: Have you an opinion on OpenCLC? Would that be out of bounds for Handmade Hero?"
    "1:10:31": "insofaras Q: How would you handle errors if you were deep in the recursion? Is checking return values everywhere the best way?"
    "1:11:18": "radlabgaming Q: I showed up late. Can you explain what introspection is?"
    "1:16:22": "Popcorn0x90 Q: Do you if Jon does \"metaprogramming\" for his language?"
    "1:17:12": "insofaras Q: Regarding errors again, would this be a place where exceptions would actually be useful?"
    "1:18:00": "evraire Q: Now that we have the preprocessor, do you plan to make more use of it going forward in Handmade Hero?"
    "1:18:18": "hoganlong Q: Who is Jon and what language are you talking about?"
    "1:18:39": "cvaucher Q: I'm writing a parser that looks pretty similar to this, but it runs on multi-GB files which takes a while. Any common approaches to use SIMD/multithreading to speed up text parsing? Seems more difficult since the characters aren't \"independent\" in the way pixels are"
    "1:20:18": "desophos Q: This stream makes me feel like an extremely inferior and incompetent programmer. Do you approve of this?"
    "1:22:58": "paulsm1th Q: How does metaprogramming change your workflow? Can you talk about incorporating generated code with the \"regular\" C files?"

* 274\. I don't know why brown butter, because it's tastier than regular... I actually like regular butter, so let's just say regular butter for now (12:42)

    "56:43": "Miblo Q: Semi-off-topic: Any chance you could describe a little more what you'd want of an algebraic blackboard program?"
    "57:18": "Blackboard: Why Casey Doesn't Like Mathematica"
    "1:02:37": "thesizik Q: Whoa..."
    "1:02:48": "areriff Q: Will there be more things like this that require math like this in further parts of the game? Although it was pretty basic, my math is a bit rusty"
    "1:06:35": "bryanwwag Q: Do you consider math to be more of a tool to solve problems or more of a learned art to be mastered?"
    "1:08:38": "lkey144 Q: Googling what I believe you wanted turned up: http://reduce-algebra.com/ Automatic and user-controlled simplification of expressions and calculations with symbolic matrices"
    "1:09:17": "symbolic_butt Q: I just wanted to note how your intuition of the transform seemed really important at finding the bug, way more important than typing the correct formula. Uh no wait"
    "1:14:46": "zilarrezko Q: I actually just learned about determinants in Linear Algebra today. Do you think we will see them later on? Are determinants used often?"
    "1:15:48": "gasto5 Q: Do you get annoyed by some symbols meaning different things in different subcategories of math?"
    "1:17:06": "cubercaleb Q: What about 3D with an isometric view?"
    "1:18:10": "jpmontielr Q: What do you think of Khan Academy as a math learning resource?"
    "1:19:39": "cubercaleb Q: Yeah, I mean a 2D game that is drawn in 3D"
    "1:20:47": "lkey144 Q: Recognizing \"the kinds of things you are working with, and the kind of problem you are working on\" is a fundamental skill. I'm not all that sure how to teach that directly, though, beyond doing something like what you are doing here, and / or repeated experience with solving problems"
    "1:24:57": "Imagining a series that is more focused on mathematical problem identification and solving"
    "1:26:10": "Close down"

    "1:22:48": "zilarrezko Q: I'm a bit behind on Handmade Hero, but do you typically bypass (for something like off-stream coding) all the simplified things like rendering a bitmap like how you were doing (DrawBitmap, like on episode 39), and go straight to the renderer? But as well as other things like structured assets and the like?"

    "1:30:35": "Run the game, see the multiple lanes, enable the software renderer and crash"

    "1:32:39": "zilarrezko Q: What if you aren't really learning from Handmade Hero? Where I've gone through episodes 1-28 about four times and I thought I knew how to do so. I tried to make the simplified win32 layer to get to the independent layer, and I found that I couldn't do it. The documentation was rough and I forgot what things did what. What would you say to people who find that they aren't learning?"
    "1:35:29": "handmade_debug.cpp: Switch from DrawProfileIn to DrawFrameBars and view the profiler"

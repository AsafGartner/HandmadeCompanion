    "1:03:16": "cubercaleb Q: I love how stb_truetype is easier and arguably better than the windows api version"
    "1:03:24": "ThisisAtticus Q: Vote on the strawpoll!"
    "1:04:43": "Robrobby Q: Does windows font have subscript and superscript support and therefore so much overbounding? Also, is the anti-alias only stored in the alpha value by windows? After seeing a pro like you struggle with this API I understand the burden you go through with it, having seen STB yesterday"
    "1:06:10": "insofaras Q: To clarify, do we have the ability to create font bitmaps with outlines on the characters that could maybe be colored separately?"
    "1:07:22": "gasto5 Q: Which one is worse: GDI or DirectInput8?"
    "1:07:34": "quartertron Q: Is today a good example of why sometimes using a library is okay?"
    "1:10:11": "SoysauceTheKid Q: Would DirectWrite (or ClearType) help out with the anti-aliasing?"
    "1:10:25": "plain_flavored Q: Ignore this if you're already doing this, but why not ship the mono bitmap as part of the asset file instead of the much larger RGBA bitmap?"
    "1:11:56": "@abnercoimbre Q: People are liking the idea of handmade.dev"
    "1:12:35": "Robrobby Q: How often do you regret using a API/lib and back-up writing your own implementation? When you are fast-paced as you maybe this sometimes is better when your knowledge of the problem is sufficient"
    "1:14:29": "BonusRocket Q: What GUI toolkit do you recommend?"
    "1:15:12": "SoysauceTheKid Q: Would CLEARTYPE_QUALITY instead of ANTIALIASED_QUALITY make a difference?"

    "1:00:51": "soysaucethekid Q: Could you explain the padding you used for the memory struct? I believe you said it was for cache-line stuff, so if you omitted it, would it just result in more cache line misses or would it crash the game?"
    "1:03:15": "fangk20 Q: How did you get to where you are today and how did you do it, in terms of coding knowledge? [see Resources, Molly Rocket]"
    "1:04:04": "torgdor Q: It's a bit early to ask, but will there be a HandmadeCon 2017?"
    "1:06:28": "jeemjam420 Q: Would you recommend any specific resource for learning C++? So far I've been using the \"learncpp\" website"
    "1:06:45": "zilarrezko Q: Have you ever used a rope to manipulate strings?"
    "1:08:31": "randolfbat Q: Aren't you going to read in pages that have been deallocated?"
    "1:11:51": "snoringtortoise Q: So with memory systems, do you always try to put extra bits of data at the end to ensure if they ask for memory from a specific address then it doesn't ruin their day?"

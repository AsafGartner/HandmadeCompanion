    "1:09:10": "yoonfan Q: Don't you have a race condition according to the C11 and C++11 memory models when you set the texture handle from the worker thread and read it on the rendering thread without any synchronization? I think you need to use an atomic operation or the compiler could mess up the generated code"
    "1:10:43": "cubercaleb Q: Why don't you render directly to the backbuffer at Molly?"
    "1:14:20": "brokenopcode Q: FYI, no you can't change pixel format once it's been set. Need to create a temp window & context, get the wgl*arb function pointers, then destroy context & window and create new window and context with wgl*arb. Very annoying but that's how it works on windows as far as I know"
    "1:15:09": "Zamar037 Q: Will we be back to the debug code and finish it up after this, or have we finished it now?"
    "1:15:23": "cubercaleb Q: Thanks for the in depth explanation. Will you be going over modern GL later?"
    "1:17:15": "garryjohanson Q: Apparently in DirectX 12 you can select a separate context for different GPUs"

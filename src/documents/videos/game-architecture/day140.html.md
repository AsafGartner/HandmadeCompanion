    "1:06:20": "Q&A"
    "1:07:33": "robrobby Q:Is the sound buffer logarithmic or linear (decibel or linear values) and do we (have to) account for that in building the sums for the buffer?"
    "1:08:04": "allgamesnetworkvideo Q: Do you already have someone composing the soundtrack?"
    "1:09:52": "tfnw Q: A reminder about the parameter order in InterlockedIncrement and the bug it covers up"
    "1:10:41": "handmade_asset.cpp: Handle the case when BeginTaskWithMemory in LoadBitmap fails"
    "1:12:04": "flaturated Q: When mixing a mono sound to stereo, volume of each channel should be 50% for center panned"
    "1:13:32": "soysaucethekid Q: Will this audio code allow you to play the same sound simultaneously (i.e. if you start the same sound before it finishes the first time)?"
    "1:13:53": "tfnw Q: The second and third parameters in the compare and swap"
    "1:14:39": "handmade_intrinsics.h: Swap those parameters in AtomicCompareExchangeUInt32 and then swap them back and instead change the funtions where it's called"
    "1:16:54": "soysaucethekid Q: The audio seems to be frame rate dependent at the moment. Could putting it in a separate thread or using interrupts (if you can), make it not frame rate dependent?"
    "1:18:35": "tfnw Q: Would you mind adding a __sync_val_compare_and_swap(Value, Expected, New) for gcc / clang"
    "1:18:55": "handmade_intrinsics.h: Add tfnw's suggestion"
    "1:20:50": "handmade.cpp: Play the music instead of the bloop, to demonstrate playing the same sound simultaneously"
    "1:22:14": "robrobby Q: So why does it work?"
    "1:22:54": "Blackboard: Separating asset data from instance data"
    "1:24:35": "cubercaleb Q: Why use a linked list as opposed to another data structure like a vector?"
    "1:25:52": "waterlimon Q: But can you take the output of the sound summer mechanism and play that?"
    "1:26:08": "Go ahead and call it"

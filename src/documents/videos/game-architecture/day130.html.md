    "1:01:21": "quikligames Q: The Ground Chunks render differently every time you go upstairs and come back down. Are you planning on fixing that before Z-sorting?"
    "1:02:08": "abnercoimbre Q: Can you address the recurring question: \"This stream isn't about making games?\" I'm tired of trying to explain what this stream is about"
    "1:05:25": "echoy0 Q: How long have you worked on this project?"
    "1:06:01": "abar4x Q: How are you deciding what gets queued or not, and high vs low?"

    "1:06:57": "betaparticlegaming Q: I don't see any object oriented patterns. Are you using object orientation?"
    "1:07:08": "krohnos Q: I assume the Yellow/Cyan/Magenta squares are for debugging. What do they represent?"

    "1:09:23": "sssmcgrath Q: You say \"3 work weeks\" but do you feel like you could maintain this pace 8 hours a day?"
    "1:10:51": "ttbjm Q: It seems like the ground chunks are only getting generated when they would actually be visible, not before. When you get the ground chunk into the low priority queue, will empty ground be visible for 1 or 2 frames while they are being generated?"
    "1:11:37": "btngames Q: Do you think at the end / near end, someone like Jon Blow would be interested in making a game with the Handmade Hero engine in a similar format to see how the game design phase evolves the engine? I know at Pixar they get new and interesting results with unplanned collaboration between artist and engineer"

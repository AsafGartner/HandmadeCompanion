    "57:50": "Q&A"
    "58:14": "mykevelli Q: Pure design question. In GetDebugViewFor() your method is named such that it's a query but it appears to be a command in some cases (in that it changes the state of the system). I've heard that you typically want to avoid this. Do you agree? Is there a reason you did this?"
    "59:53": "elxenoaizd Q: Do you think learning all the algorithms and data structures is a must, or is it OK to learn them when the need for one of them rises? Or is it one of those things that you have to learn beforehand in order to know if you need them or not?"
    "1:02:01": "Insobot Q: 4bugger... No libraries. You need a new game maker?"
    "1:02:16": "quartertron	Q: Binary search tree is a subset of BTree, I think"
    "1:03:07": "Rfh666 Q: About your memory allocation (way back when): Shouldn't the amount of memory you allocate depend on the size of the world chosen by the user? As it is, it is fixed at compile time (if I understand correctly)"
    "1:05:29": "elxenoaizd Q: I would like to be a tools programmer / game tech writer like you, but I'm still learning things so I'm not fully qualified to work as one. I'm thinking of working in a simple game company where the qualifications aren't so hardcore (maybe they use Unity or whatever), and at the same time do my private low-level self-learning. Good idea? Yes / No"
    "1:08:35": "bewbilicious Q: What are your plans for streaming once you complete this game?"
    "1:08:46": "abnercoimbre Q: You've discussed using Blender. Are you a 3D modeller of some sort? More specifically, what operations do you do with that software package?"
    "1:10:09": "quartertron Q: I'd like to see a Blender pre-stream demo"
    "1:10:30": "TheSizik Q: Would you consider doing a short off-hours stream to show people how you do things (like metaprogramming) that you won't get to touch on in Handmade Hero?"
    "1:11:08": "Roots2D Q: Hey, love catching the stream when I can. What language do you recommend as a beginner programmer looking to get into game development?"
    "1:14:51": "Stream is over"

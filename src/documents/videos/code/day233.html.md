    "1:24:09": "insofaras Q: I didn't look this up so it might not work, but came up with: whenever an element from the upper half is chosen, put it in place in the lower half, shift the upper half down to fill the space that the chosen element used to take up, and store the non-chosen element from the lower half in the new space at the end of the upper half, setting the lower half's read pointer to that end bit. Thoughts?"

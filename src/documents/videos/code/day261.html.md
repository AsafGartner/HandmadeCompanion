But as well as other things like structured assets and the like?"

    "1:32:39": "zilarrezko Q: What if you aren't really learning from Handmade Hero? Where I've gone through episodes 1-28 about four times and I thought I knew how to do so. I tried to make the simplified win32 layer to get to the independent layer, and I found that I couldn't do it. The documentation was rough and I forgot what things did what. What would you say to people who find that they aren't learning?"
    "1:35:29": "handmade_debug.cpp: Switch from DrawProfileIn to DrawFrameBars and view the profiler"
    "1:36:10": "Call it"

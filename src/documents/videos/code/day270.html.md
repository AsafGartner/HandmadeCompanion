    "56:46": "chronaldragon Q: So how will this tile-based movement work? Will you still be able to move freely within a tile, or will the character actually \"snap\" to a tile?"
    "57:06": "fyoucon Q: When will we sort out the coordinate system?"
    "57:31": "friggodin Q: Is it possible to get access to the source code if I lost access to my old email account?"
    "58:53": "Miblo Q: How about stairwells? Their traversal used to be seamless, as far as I remember. Now that the rooms are locked, how will stairwells work?"
    "59:33": "theiburley Q: Any plans on changing to Visual Studio Code instead of the full IDE? I believe the full debugger is included"
    "1:00:13": "longboolean Q: What are the benefits / trade-offs in having each tile be an entity?"
    "1:02:44": "tobeypeters Q: Are you allocating your entities on the heap or stack? Heap, right? Could you even allocate enough stuff on the stack?"
    "1:05:47": "btngames Q: Do you foresee complications with the new grid entity floor system and the texture splats given you want a variable height per Traversable entity?"
    "1:06:25": "dudeinbasement1 Q: Handle @Rbnelr confusion over atomics"
    "1:06:53": "Rbnelr Q: So if modern CPUs usually reorder or merge writes, how do they use memory mapped registers? Can you even bit-bang a serial protocol with it?"
    "1:09:30": "longboolean Q: What is the plan with rendering when the hero walks behind a piece of terrain that is on a higher level, and obscures the hero?"
    "1:09:59": "jim0_o Q: Will this system fix the collision areas getting stuck in each other if stacked, e.g. two heroes loading at the same position?"
    "1:10:48": "Shut down"
    "1:11:16": "Announce that the Handmade Hero forums will be going down this weekend while Handmade Network launches [see Resources]"

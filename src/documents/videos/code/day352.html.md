    "2:01:37": "godling72 Q: 1) Do you ever work on large (multimillion LOC) codebases like Chrome, GCC, Unreal, etc? The full build dev process you've been using works for small projects, but how do you scale?"
    "2:05:22": "godling Q: 2) Why is past video archiving disabled?"
    "2:06:13": "godling Q: 3) Are you in a closet? The back wall looks really close"
    "2:06:19": "sevesos2 Q: I don't know if unrelated questions are allowed, but how do you stay so focused on your programming and are so efficient?"
    "2:09:21": "mtsmox Q: I think the speedup is due to wrong offsets of the simulation regions for the multithreaded tasks: you used tile size for your calculation, not chunk / room size"
    "2:09:47": "iantjac Q: Now that you intend to use 3D, will the code support software rendering?"
    "2:10:03": "dsjimenez Q: Is the career advice episode uploaded anywhere? I'm having trouble finding it"
    "2:10:25": "mtsmox Q: You said you wanted to remove the notion of rooms / layers from the drawing routine, but don't you still need it for fading in the room above you?"
    "2:11:28": "a_pulsing_mage Q: You said that 20 seconds to build is a reasonable amount of time? It's huge! 10 seconds is too much"
    "2:13:09": "gene_victor Q: Off-topic: Will HandmadeCon 2016 VOD be on YouTube soon?"
    "2:13:28": "godling72 Q: How long did The Witness take to build?"
    "2:15:15": "popcorn0x90 Q: I would think it would take about 5-10 mins"
    "2:15:49": "Wrap it up"

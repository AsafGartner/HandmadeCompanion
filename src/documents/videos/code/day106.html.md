    "57:40": "pseudonym73 Q: Did I see that correctly, that the ground shadow jumps along with the hero?"
    "58:17": "ifingerbangedurcat Q: Slightly off topic but, can you quickly go over the concept behind MoveSpec? Why not have every entity have their own velocity/drag, etc. values instead? Just for organization?"
    "59:06": "mr4thdimention Q: Is the jump a real mechanic or just for making the system robust?"
    "59:29": "nicstop Q: Why don't you pre-compose hero bitmaps into a single bitmap at initialization, so there would not be fussing with pushing pieces?"
    "1:00:12": "robotchocolatedino Q: When you are walking up a staircase, will the character suddenly snap back on Y when you transition to the next Z slice?"
    "1:00:54": "rsxole Q: If I'm not mistaken, with your way of Z-scaling it's going to be hard to support large (in Z) structures such as tall walls that should be aligned across different Z levels, no? Imagine a multi story house or so"
    "1:02:22": "cubercaleb Q: If there are going to be pits/ledges in the game, how are you going to render those?"
    "1:02:47": "anonymous835 Q: I wonder how the ball would work with the zoom in"
    "1:05:30": "rohit_n Q: What games do the \"bad\" fade-out effect you mentioned?"
    "1:06:13": "cubercaleb Q: How will the staircase be scaled when you are moving up and down it?"

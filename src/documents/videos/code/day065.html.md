    "1:07:13": "Assuming we don't go wandering too much on our own, which week has accumulated enough code base for a basic, simple, fully functional game?"
    "1:09:04": "Regarding high and low entities, would the following solution work?  Using one entity struct, all entities are stored in one array, and frequently update the entity if the entity is within camera bounds, and use low-frequency updating if it's outside the camera bounds?"
    "1:11:45": "Can you give a high-level overview of how entities work now?  I get it in bits and pieces, but this week has lost me."
    "1:19:59": "I'm not sure I fully caught how short-lived/temporary/transient memory is?  Is it only for single frames or longer lived?  If for longer-lived memory, how do you make sure you don't wrap around and start overwriting memory still in use?  Think some homing attack which takes many many frames to resolve."
    "1:21:25": "How do you determine how much time each sim region should be updated if they aren't updated each frame?"
    "1:21:54": "How does the work during this experimental phase fit into the final code?  Will we be re-using most of it or will we be starting from scratch?"

    "56:35": "Connor_Rentz Q: We all just saw a black screen, not a pink screen..."
    "57:03": "cubercaleb Q: According to this you should use 32 for the ColorBit [see Resources, OpenGL]"
    "57:58": "garryjohanson Q: Curious if the CPU or the GPU actually communicates the information to the screen. I feel you mentioned this, but I forgot"
    "59:01": "1213lac Q: What are your thoughts about Vulkan?"
    "59:14": "sssmcgrath Q: If you're ever in the mood to do a straight-up unrelated tutorial stream, IO completion ports would be great cause I ain't reading about that ***"
    "59:40": "ChaiLatteQuinoa Q: What do you think of Nvidia GE Force does not clear memory?"
    "59:54": "elxenoaizd Q: Came in late. Do we have our own GL function pointers loaded now?"
    "1:00:39": "insofaras Q: Try a color other than pink? OBS might treat that as transparent"
    "1:01:09": "slashac Q: Do you know why they deprecate GL_ALPHA?"
    "1:01:27": "Novynn Q: You don't need the DescribePixelFormat call, since when you use ChoosePixelFormat it modifies your DesiredPixelFormat with the correct stuff"
    "1:02:17": "cubercaleb Q: Since we will have a depth buffer, does the Z-sort really matter anymore?"
    "1:03:12": "Novynn Q: My bad! Looks like OpenGL docs are lying to me again"
    "1:03:22": "Ikkir_Isth Q: Going to be doing multiple GL versions, or just the minimum for general Win XP machines? (What version are most of them even on anyway?)"
    "1:04:08": "Snovind92 Q: Would there be any benifit of using the new versions of OpenGL for a game like Handmade Hero?"
    "1:04:30": "MadEqua Q: Is there a difference when calling a function (like glClear()) on the opengl32.lib vs the one on the graphics driver dll?"
    "1:04:46": "Blackboard: Code library vs Import library"
    "1:06:36": "Quatzequatel Q: Since we are using OpenGL, will you be modifying our 2.5D'ness or keep the code as is?"
    "1:06:49": "evraire Q: For ChoosePixelFormat() were we not supposed to specify iPixelType and set it to PFD_TYPE_RGBA?"
    "1:07:27": "win32_handmade.cpp: Set DesiredPixelFormat.iPixelType"
    "1:08:14": "angus_holder Q: So by linking against opengl32.lib we don't need to use GetProcAddress at all with OpenGL?"
    "1:08:56": "Blackboard: Dynamic link table"
    "1:14:56": "1213lac Q: Since you are complaining about windows pretty often, why don't you use another operating system?"
    "1:15:48": "MrSlick1015 Q: Do you think for the OS X port will you need a wrapper written in Objective-C to get use OpenGL and make a window?"
    "1:16:20": "garryjohanson Q: This is probably dumb, but what about offloading much of the computing we are doing onto the GPU using OpenCL, then not use OpenGL and keep things mostly as is?"
    "1:17:37": "cubercaleb Q: Over the break I wrote a program that generates OpenGL function pointer declarations and initialization by scanning cpp/h files to determine what needs to be added. Do you plan on doing something similar for Handmade Hero or will you keep it simple?"
    "1:17:54": "slashac Q: How bad is an if statement in a shader?"
    "1:18:13": "Vidster88 Q: Have you ever programmed for a console?"

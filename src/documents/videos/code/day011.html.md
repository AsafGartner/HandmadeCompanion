    "3:35": "About platform specific code"
    "7:56": "What is left to be done on the platform layer"
    "11:23": "Topic of the day revealed!"
    "11:33": "Portability and cross platformness"
    "13:37": "How people used to make code be cross platform (preprocessor #if #else)"
    "18:48": "About preprocessor #if #else cross platforming"
    "23:52": "Separate platform files (e.g. linux_handmade.cpp) as the entry point"
    "31:41": "Unity builds, building your project as one translation unit"
    "34:08": "Virtualising the OS to the game (architecture style 1)"
    "34:23": "Example implementation for virtualising a window wrapper"
    "42:54": "Reasons why perhaps not to use style 1"

    "51:30": "GameUpdateAndRender() - moving RenderWeirdGradient to game code"
    "1:01:00": "Start of Q&A"
    "1:01:23": "Seems 'unsafe' to include the platform independent code after including the platform specific headers"
    "1:03:22": "Would you always orchestrate how you do threading in the platform layer or does it make sense for the platform layer to also provide a more generic threading job service?"
    "1:05:12": "You said last stream you didn't really like showing the FPS because you didn't find it useful. Can you explain that?"
    "1:09:48": "On the scale from genius to totally awesome how can you remember all this?"
    "1:12:21": "Do we currently have a hidden platform dependancy inside the bitmap memory or is BGRA something that happens on the other platforms too?"
    "1:15:18": "It seems like your approach to handling platform dependant services is to prefer a many-to-one relationship instead of a one-to-many. [...]"
    "1:17:53": "How did you setup Visual Studio to have that black theme?"
    "1:18:22": "During coding is it easy to discipline yourself to make the code as clean and tidy as possible. [...] Do you think this is good in general or could it backfire?"
    "1:22:20": "Would there be a way to build your platform dependant code in a separate entity in order to allow you to use it in the future?"
    "1:23:11": "Will you be developing your own implementation of strings? (No) "
    "1:23:52": "Does the unity build approach work with parallel compilation?"
    "1:26:04": "Do you feel it is necessary to make a flowchart before coding, or do you go with the flow?"
    "1:27:18": "Why the #define part for the header file (include guards)"
    "1:29:09": "Why do you specify void in function definitions when they don't take arguments?"
    "1:30:06": "Do you have a specific method for solving programming problems or do you just write things and solve them in place?"
    "1:30:29": "Why are you forward declaring game layer functions in the header when you include the whole documentation?"
    "1:31:17": "Do you think it is realistic for someone with awful math skills to be an efficient game developer?"

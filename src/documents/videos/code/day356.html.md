    "1:59:26": "Q&A"
    "2:00:29": "zilarrezko Q: Hey Casey, is anyone planning on doing a more boiled down version of Handmade Hero, to take apart the game and give a breakdown of the aspect of each system in the project?"
    "2:01:13": "Miblo Q: Or make the camera pan within the room?"
    "2:01:33": "highergravity Q: Long time archive viewer, but first time live streamer! I have two pre-stream questions but I can never make the pre-stream time. 1) Do you have a strong opinion about why int *p is \"superior style\" than int* p, or are you impartial to whatever the developer prefers?"
    "2:02:12": "Demo: Pointer declaration style"
    "2:04:40": "highergravity Q: 2) Do compiler optimisations (-O2) guarantee that the same output is generated for time-independent code? That is, does the out-of-order processing ever introduce some nasty logic / contol flow bugs that -Od wouldn't?"
    "2:08:01": "mtsmox Q: You said you didn't want to use PRETTY_FUNCTION because that wouldn't work because of duplicate GUIDs. But the only place where PRETTY_FUNCTION would have been used is in TIMED_FUNCTION, which should never be used more then once in any function anyway. So not using DEBUG_NAME in TIMED_FUNCTION would solve the problem. All the other calls to TIMED_BLOCK_ would still work with DEBUG_NAME and thus use the COUNTER to be unique. So I think the extra field for the Name is really not necessary."
    "2:08:55": "zennmystic Q: You talked about GCC / CLANG at the start. To be clear, you will be dropping visual studio at some point?"
    "2:09:43": "linike860 Q: What is your opinion on Minkowski Portal Refinement for collision detection and response? I feel it is much nicer as it gives you much of the collision information (normal, depth, etc.) without having to implement an entire separate algorithm like GJK does"
    "2:10:26": "zilarrezko Q: Have you tried -Ox for optimizations? I believe it gives even faster code (it's a fast hand for multiple optimization flags, I believe)"
    "2:12:36": "garryjohanson Q: I would like to cast my vote that we should do the slides some day"
    "2:12:57": "tukimitzu Q: How long do you think it will take for JAI to take over the C++ space in the game industry? It's not even out yet and I can already say that language is the best thing ever designed"
    "2:14:54": "ray_caster Q: Are you using SDL? If not and, assuming the answer isn't just \"everything needs to be hand-made\", is there another reason? What are your thoughts in general on SDL?"
    "2:17:50": "zennmystic Q: I guess what I was really asking was will you be dropping it?"
    "2:19:02": "azmreece Q: Do you have any thoughts on when to use multiple threads? Is the answer any more in depth than \"when single-threaded isn't fast enough\"?"
    "2:21:26": "tuxiak Q: Do you still have a TODO list like you used to? Could you show it? I'm still on Day ~110 with the videos"
    "2:21:51": "Wrap it up"

    "1:07:32": "mr4thdimention Q: If you want your game to be full screen, how would you want to handle screens with different aspect ratios?"

    "1:09:00": "ttbjm Q: Tiny shadows look funny"
    "1:10:15": "@chronaldragon Q: It could be interesting to have larger trees that span multiple Z-levels. Don't know how well it would work in our style"
    "1:10:38": "insofaras Q: Will the game support scaling to arbitrary resolutions now?"
    "1:12:06": "dangalf_ Q: Could you explain what the #if #endif stuff is for and when/how you use it?"
    "1:14:12": "ttbjm Q: Will the stairs have different artwork for the top and bottom and if so how would you make them seamless? Per step artwork each at their own height?"
    "1:15:47": "plain_flavored Q: Can we at least get some crappy MS paint programmer art stairs in there instead of yellow blocks?"
    "1:15:55": "plain_flavored Q: What happened to the cool velocity boost from stairwells?"

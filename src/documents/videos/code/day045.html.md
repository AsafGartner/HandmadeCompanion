    "1:03:57": "You start variables uppercase and structs lowercase. Why?"
    "1:04:47": "When npc's are introduced, will they reuse some of the code shown here?"
    "1:05:54": "Are you going to implement push/squeeze through doorways?"
    "1:07:31": "It seems like the possible movement is more like a pizza-slice?"

    "1:10:07": "Will we have to push boulders out of the way of doors?"
    "1:10:24": "Will you ever fall for some of the dogmatic traps when coding?"
    "1:13:11": "Does the search method here give the sense of rounded corners?"
    "1:14:14": "I don't really understand this. Why not just change the players vector with normals?"
    "1:16:21": "Are you going to worry about how many objects the collision detection system can handle?"
    "1:18:12": "For search in p, don't you have a problem with passing through walls?"
    "1:19:35": "Will the search code work if he hits a small notch that would make him bounce back?"
    "1:21:15": "Will you implement secrets when none of us are watching?"
    "1:22:20": "Will the characters have skeletal animations?"
    "1:23:39": "Will the search in p work with moving objects?"
    "1:25:20": "A great deal of the problems you've faced seems to be around tradeoffs.."

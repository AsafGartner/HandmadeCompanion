    "55:03": "asafgartner Q: Can you try compiling with debug off?"
    "55:41": "handmade_world_mode.cpp: Enable DEBUGPickEntity() and DEBUG_PLATFORM_GET_MEMORY_STATS() to be compiled out"
    "57:39": "badflydog Q: CTime stats. I know I know. It's irrelevant for the code"
    "58:31": "Run CTime"
    "59:48": "chaoscom Q: What does the \"...\" do in the define?"
    "1:00:06": "handmade.cpp: Demo varargs"
    "1:09:26": "flirtychair Q: How about documentation? I see you don't have too much comments in your code"
    "1:12:45": "tomisqi Q: I sometimes receive comments from colleagues during code reviews that I should put long pieces of code into functions for \"cleanliness\". What parameters go into your thought process when deciding if a piece of code should be placed under a function? How do you make the decision?"
    "1:18:16": "lvias Q: How much code is debug code vs real code?"
    "1:20:15": "uplinkcoder Q: Expand the files and take the diffs?"

    "2:25:15": "Kknewkles Q: (vicariously asked by @Miblo) o7 Casey! Two questions: 1) Have you finished Sausage Roll? I have! >:D 2) I have been Shilling Knight for you to play Shovel Knight, and now I have to add Undertale to the list. That game a gift from gods on high"
    "2:26:17": "a_pulsing_mage Q: Isn't simulating the world in several threads, can't that make the game non deterministic? Isn't the point of the RNG having a starting kernel for deterministic play for competition and stuff?"
    "2:29:14": "Blackboard: RNG in Handmade Hero"
    "2:32:32": "thegeekpirate Q: When do you go back and complete \"TODO\" tasks you've given yourself in the code? Is each one going to be completed before you're done, or are they simply wishlists?"
    "2:33:14": "sumsar10171 Q: Is it important for a game programmer to have a portfolio in the same way artists do and, if so, what would be important to include? [see Resources, Molly Rocket]"
    "2:34:53": "garryjohanson Q: In a tight inner loop do you think these memory copies for the temporary scratch memory could become an overhead concern? If I understood the stream correctly, that is"
    "2:35:31": "longboolean Q: Currently what is the behavior when walking several rooms over, into another chunk?"
    "2:36:13": "williambundy Q: Save scumming?"
    "2:36:21": "jim0_o Q: Will there be streams from the job fair people?"
    "2:36:48": "marcramhim Q: What's the relation between IQ and success at programming?"
    "2:37:20": "ginger_bill Q: Off-topic question which can be answered later if necessary. I've been developing a new programming language to replace my needs for C/C++ and pretty much every other language. The main areas of research for me at the moment are: Metaprogramming, SSA optimizations, Concurrency. You being a metaprogramming \"expert\", other than Compile Time Execution (CTE) that is Jon's language, what other forms of metaprogramming would you like?"
    "2:37:50": "williambundy Q: Sorry, it was in context: if I open a chest, and don't get what I want, reloading a save game and playing slightly differently might get me a different RNG for the chest"
    "2:40:36": "ginger_bill Q: Will the game have different \"levels\" like the Binding of Isaac, or will the entire game be a single \"level\"?"
    "2:42:13": "Wind it down"

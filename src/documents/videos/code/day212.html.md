## Quotes

* 286\. In sync, like the band. Like the Backstreet Boys, but different (1:10)
* 287\. I've got 10 minutes left on the clock, so I'm gonna use them. I'm gonna use them to nefarious ends, is what I'm gonna do. I am gonna go ahead and straight up do weird stuff with that (48:25)
* 288\. The first time someone told me about C++, it was pretty funny because I thought they were describing something sensible (1:10:20)

    "1:07:02": "uliori Q: Hi, I am way behind you in the series, but you talked about \"mixin\". I donâ€™t know if you did this yet, but can you please explain it?"
    "1:11:44": "macielda Q: Are you working on entity interactions soon (like fire weapons vs ice monster, poisonous arrows and stuff like that)?"
    "1:11:55": "tinyconstruct Q: (Very off-topic) Can you think of the last time you took a dynamic programming approach to a problem (e.g. shortest edit distance, optimal BSTs, etc)? DP algorithms are allegedly a common interview topic, despite how silly that seems"

    "1:33:45": "teryrords Q: Speaking of past jobs, would you rather see a job at a Java shop (industry experience) vs. a local college's faculty for High Performance Computing (academia)?"
    "1:36:11": "dsjimenez Q: Great interview answer, thanks. The only issue I've had with that is candidates who have no projects they're proud enough to really talk about, and I feel like I'm judging them unfairly for not having the same interest for programming outside of work / class"
    "1:37:42": "longboolean Q: What are some things that can cause a smart individual who has a good understanding of programming to not be productive, and what can be done to eliminate these causes?"
    "1:40:18": "roam00010011 Q: But people do come with big claims on their resume, you got to at least ask about pointer math if you're hiring a C expert"
    "1:41:46": "chochmah Q: Who wouldn't know how to reverse a linked list? You can do that on the spot"
    "1:44:37": "jkugelman Q: Often I have a hard time digging in to people's past projects because they throw out tons of acronyms, jargon, frameworks, etc., that I'm not familiar with. Maybe they've worked in a completely different industry, like medical or defense, and their work context is totally unfamiliar to me. How do you handle that?"
    "1:46:34": "sssmcgrath Q: I like this interview methodology. Maybe in a chat stream one day you could mock interview someone (me?) as a demonstration"
    "1:47:10": "mvandevander Q: I think we need to title it \"Casey Muratori's Enhanced Interview Techniques\""
    "1:47:43": "sssmcgrath Q: I'll do it another day if you want (can't tonight)!"
    "1:48:22": "superjercom Q: This is actually already how I do interviews. The problem is people tend to be totally blindsided by being asked about their own experience"
    "1:49:34": "On how this technique is impervious to hacking"
    "1:52:08": "Gotta go and reboot the machine"

    "1:06:23": "Question: We have small code right now. How does dynamic linking and compiling to an exe work with huge games that are multiple gigs?"
    "1:07:39": "Casey spoils tomorrows stream by telling people not to spoil it"
    "1:08:00": "Short recap on loops"
    "1:10:28": "Question: Do you recommend playing around with dll files, or are they mainly used in specific cases?"
    "1:11:05": "Question: Can someone now create a dummy handmade.dll and use it to intercept the GameUpdateAndRender function to get a pointer to game memory and change stuff. Is security something you will cover in a later stream?"
    "1:13:34": "Question: We've got a tiny application right now so if code takes minutes to compile, how are we going to do what we just did?"
    "1:16:08": "Question: Would you be able to load the dll yourself using ReadFile() and implement getProcAddress() as well, assuming there's an easy way to make the memory executable like mmap()"
    "1:18:16": "Question: Is this technique still possible without using passing of the large memory blob between the dll and the exe?"
    "1:21:00": "Question: Does the dll prevent the compiler from inlining?"
    "1:21:47": "Question: How are we going to implement dll's on Linux/Mac?"
    "1:23:02": "Question: Are you ever going to write the platform layers for other platforms on the stream in the far future?"
    "1:24:02": "Question: Is the process roughly the same for doing the Linux equivalent of sharing libraries?"
    "1:25:42": "Question: Your #define typedef magic kinda bugs me, in that it hides the arguments/return type away from the implementation. How much of a win is having the signature in one place?"
    "1:26:54": "Question: How does Windows manage memory in a dll? Is there a dll process page? Where are variables made/the statics stored? How is heap managed when allocated from a dll?"
    "1:37:14": "Question: Doesn't Windows know [who called it] by the instruction pointers leading up to the VirtualAlloc() call?"

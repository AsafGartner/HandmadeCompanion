    "1:16:18": "Can you explain the motivation behind controlling the page granularity."
    "1:22:35": "Is the memory arena for more temporary objects than we're storing in the game state directly?"
    "1:25:30": "Why not have smooth scrolling?"
    "1:26:20": "We already have the -Oi compiler flag set."
    "1:29:32": "Does using the memory arena still allow you to hotload your code?"
    "1:31:31": "Will we be implementing our own trig functions?"
    "1:32:00": "Will there be enough memory to store the entire sparse tile map?"
    "1:32:43": "Why not just allocate a large 1D array?"
    "1:35:40": "You're using a lot of pointers here. (Rant)"
    "1:39:33": "Will the memory arena be aligning the assigned memory?"
    "1:39:52": "Don't forget to disable -O2 again."

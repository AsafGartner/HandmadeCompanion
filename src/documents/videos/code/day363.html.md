    "2:02:07": "aceflameseer Q: Sorry for being a dummy: In the camera transform in 3D games (as far as I've been watching tutorials), there's something called an \"Up\" vector. What's the purpose of it and do we have it in Handmade Hero? Since it's a 2D game I guess it's different. Your explanations have been wonderful and I would love it if you could explain it. And also thanks for doing EU friendly streams Kappa"

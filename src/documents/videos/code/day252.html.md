## Quotes

* 412\. Are you ready for this? Because this is ridiculous (41:16)
* 413\. It's a little pointer-chasey (55:54)
* 414\. Whoops, that function doesn't exist in 4coder yet, you can't call it, Casey! (1:02:11)
* 415\. I forgot about the particle system. I forgot that it was using the hero's head (1:15:52)

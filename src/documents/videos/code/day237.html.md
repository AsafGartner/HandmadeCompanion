    "1:10:18": "insofaras Q: I think in old OpenGL you don't even need glGenTextures, you can just pick your own arbitrary ints"
    "1:10:31": "win32_handmade.cpp: Set GlobalBlitTextureHandle = 1; rather than using glGenTextures"

    "1:13:39": "garryjohanson Q: In your professional career what GPU library have you preferred, such as OpenGL, DirectX, GLSL, etc.? Which one do you currently use and why?"
    "1:14:03": "ChronalDragon Q: Later on, after we upgrade to more modern OpenGL, will the game render into a framebuffer and then onto the same triangles, or will you just have it render directly to the main window buffer?"
    "1:15:25": "macielda Q: Before you removed the Init variable and inline initialization of the texture you were always passing 0 as the name, by the way"
    "1:15:56": "macielda Q: So there is no way to blit directly to the back buffer anymore?"
    "1:17:29": "robrobby Q: Is there a difference in speed now we use OpenGL to move the buffer to the GPU?"
    "1:19:41": "garryjohanson Q: Is there a way you know of to optimize PCI transfers between CPU and GPU using OpenGL?"
    "1:22:39": "sssmcgrath Q: I dunno if this is applicable to the last question, I literally just got here, but glTexSubImage2D could be faster than glTexImage2D"

    "1:29:26": "quartertron Q: At what point in that chain of gl commands does the card actually get involved? Command dependent? Driver dependent?"

markers:
    "0:15": "Recap and plan for today"
    "1:22": "The game runs slow because every frame we're collating all events for the past 64 debug frames"
    "2:10": "Decreasing the amount of debug frames we process from 64 to 8"
    "4:01": "We want to extract more information from the debug display"
    "6:20": "We want the debug display to show us information associated to any bar when we hover over it"
    "6:45": "Passing the game input to the debug system so that it can access the mouse position"
    "7:47": "Checking if the mouse position falls inside any given rectangle"
    "10:05": "The information to display will come from a debug_record associated to the debug_frame_region"
    "11:45": "Adding a debug record and a cycle count to debug_frame_region"
    "13:23": "Building a rectangle to test if the mouse pointer falls inside"
    "16:30": "Implementing a version of PushRect that takes a rectangle as its argument"
    "17:44": "Testing. It runs but hovering doesn't work yet"
    "18:26": "The mouse position is relative to Window' coordinate space, not to our rendering space"
    "20:35": "Transforming mouse coordinates to the game space"
    "22:30": "Hover works now"
    "23:00": "Changing the position of the debug text on the screen"
    "25:01": "Our ms/frame display shows 0 ms because we're computing it using the information from an unclosed frame"
    "27:07": "We don't want the game layer to depend on Windows' representation of mouse position. The platform layer should transform it into the game's coordinate system"
    "28:30": "Transforming the mouse position inside win32_handmade.cpp"
    "30:30": "(Blackboard) If we want the leftmost and rightmost columns of our backbuffer to have the same absolute X, the (0,0) coordinate will fall on a pixel boundary"

    "46:58": "We're not clearing the mouse state!"
    "48:45": "Clearing the half-transition count at the start of each frame"
    "50:36": "See if we can write something that's not total garbage (!quote 243)"
    "52:17": "Testing. It works"
    "53:07": "Q&A"
    "53:31": "quartertron Q: Put the Pig Hat on the Owl"
    "53:45": "Sharlock93 Q: You had four Owl of Shame moments"
    "53:56": "insofaras Q: Mouse code bugged for over 150 days, bring on the Owl"
    "54:29": "Connor_Rentz Q: Will almond milk make me smarter?"
    "54:43": "Sharlock93 Q: And on behalf of all the people here, we love you and you are awesome"
    "55:26": "epigone00 Q: I'm new here. Why constrain yourself to 1-hour segments? Isn't ramp-up time every day hard?"
    "56:29": "tombsar Q: How would you go about optimizing the debug rendering? It looks as though there is a lot of unnecessary work with EntityBasis calculation, etc."
    "57:42": "build.bat: -O2 some of that up"
    "58:57": "JamesWidman Q: You've trained everyone to listen for whether you pronounce the letter \"t\", or its allophone, the glottal stop, when you say the word \"buttons\""
    "59:23": "ChronalDragon Q: Shoot, wasn't paying attention and I used the mouse code in another program. What was broken about it?"
    "59:42": "JamesWidman Q: At some point, would it make sense to pause and re-display the frame that is currently moused-over?"
    "1:00:28": "Sharlock93 Q: By the way, I'm from iraq, and it's 4am right now. Can you some time do early stream? I don't mind not sleeping until 4am, but in 2-3 weeks university starts and it would be awesome if you bring back early hours"
    "1:00:59": "quartertron Q: I think you only render \"top level\" debug timed functions etc. Are you planning on \"drilling down?\""
    "1:01:12": "fierydrake Q: What is the other long bar? Some kind of frame wait? Should it be that long?"
    "1:01:22": "d1srupt0r Q: Are you an indie developer and / or is this your professional job? If not, what is your day job?"
    "1:01:47": "tombsar Q: I forget if the white line is 33ms or 16ms. Could you add a green line for 60Hz, orange for 30, and red for 10, or something?"
    "1:02:09": "Eggsodragon Q: I noticed in task manager that all of my Steam games are 32-bit processes. Is there a really good reason to compile games in 32-bits rather than 64?"
    "1:03:20": "SoysauceTheKid Q: The debug display is for processing time. Are you going to do any visuals for memory usage?"
    "1:04:04": "Sharlock93 Q: Would you be willing to do a 1-2 hour prestream?"
    "1:04:20": "Wind it down (!quote 244)"

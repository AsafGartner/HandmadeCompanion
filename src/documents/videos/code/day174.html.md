What are your thoughts on commenting your code, considering a lot of it is pretty complicated, unless of course you don't see it as such? Or do you think that since you write good code, it doesn't require comments to be readable?"

    "1:06:13": "pseudonym73 Q: Or a real hash function?"
    "1:07:06": "jameswidman Q: My comment-writing rule for a while has been: \"code should clearly tell you what is being done; comments, if you need them, should only tell you why\""

* 193\. Knock knock! - Who's there? - Fonts are done. - Fonts are done who? - There's no "fonts are done who?", the fonts are just done. Right. Stop knocking on my door. I don't know why... although, in that case I would've been the person knocking. Doesn't matter, it's not relevant (37:07)

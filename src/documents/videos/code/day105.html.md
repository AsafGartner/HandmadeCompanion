    "57:38": "stelar7 Q: Why are you using AlignX and AlignY, instead of a v2 (in bitmap)?"
    "1:00:08": "stelar7 Q: Shouldn't the shadow move somewhat up when he jumps (because of the angled viewport)?"
    "1:00:51": "cubercaleb Q: Could you make the circle reflect a bitmap like a tree if you wanted?"
    "1:03:05": "stelar7 Q: Can you let the orb sample from the ground, or is that some time away?"
    "1:06:29": "gasto5 Q: How much zooming will the game support?"
    "1:06:55": "limyc Q: I keep hearing you say entity, but I take it you don't mean entity in the Entity Component System sense. Is that correct?"
    "1:07:18": "btngames Q: You were going to add a comment to your ZFudge code to say why XY was used only, not Z to avoid skewing trees, character, etc"
    "1:08:00": "ca2dev Q: I think I missed the day, but the bitmap is being texturized using a normal function (into the sphere)?"
    "1:08:10": "insofaras Q: When are we going to scale the hero down?"
    "1:08:50": "Casey feels like there's a bug with our edges"
    "1:09:15": "gasto5 Q: Would you implement a \"lamp in a dark room\" effect with shadow mapping?"
    "1:10:42": "stelar7 Q: Will there be emitters of some kind, like sparks from a fire?"
    "1:11:04": "gasto5 Q: How would you implement a lamp in a dark room effect in a 2D game?"
    "1:12:05": "ca2dev Q: Is it common in game development to use normal function for texturizing? Is it performant? Or is it much more common to break in texturizing triangles surfaces?"
    "1:14:07": "insofaras Q: Will the entities have projected shadows or just blob shadows like the head has currently?"
    "1:15:08": "stelar7 Q: \"Un-optimized\"? Don't you have -O2 on?"
    "1:16:20": "ttbjm Q: Will the shadow be reflected in the normal map?"
    "1:16:37": "gasto5 Q: Will the particles effects system interact with the normal maps?"
    "1:17:30": "Go ahead and close things down for the day, then"

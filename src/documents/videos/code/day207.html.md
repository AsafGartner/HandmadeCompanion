    "1:07:22": "ChronalDragon Q: So when you say you've built up multiple layers of metaprogramming, do you mean your metaprograms output things like what we wrote today?"
    "1:07:59": "nxsy Q: Isn't offsetof fairly safe to rely on with remotely recent compilers?"
    "1:08:26": "handmade.cpp: Try using offsetof"
    "1:10:25": "blah238 Q: Someone said that the string function you were looking for was called strdup"
    "1:10:43": "garryjohanson Q: In the episode of the Jeff and Casey Show \"The Wolf Doesn't Want to Come Anymore\" you mentioned that you use metaprogramming techniques to make up for modern language shortcomings. Curious what functionality you have used metaprogramming to achieve that you would have found prohibitive in modern languages? Can you suggest any specific usages to pursue for either program robustness, optimization, etc.?"
    "1:12:25": "ChronalDragon Q: To rephrase, are your \"multiply layered\" metaprograms outputting further metaprograms? Or is it a single layer that has enough complexity to be considered more than a single pass? (Not sure how to phrase, I was mostly trying to prompt further discussion of what you've mentioned previously)"
    "1:14:04": "JamesWidman Q: Odd... offsetof is defined in MSVC's <stddef.h>, and is specified in C '89 as belonging to that header... Did I miss something?"
    "1:15:12": "Debugger: Use the test project to Go to Definition of offsetof"
    "1:17:09": "binjimin Q: Based on what Jonathan Blow has so far, do you think JAI will have the metaprogramming capabilities that you'd want? If not, what do you think it is missing?"
    "1:18:23": "paulsm1th Q: You said in a previous stream that you don't really program in C anymore, you basically program in \"Caseylang\". Does that refer to your metaprogramming tools or is there more to it than that?"
    "1:18:38": "d7samurai Q: You're not using header files for OpenGL / Direct3D?"
    "1:18:48": "sjohn_c Q: Have you worked with any functional languages? Haskell or maybe Scala?"
    "1:19:25": "blah238 Q: Maybe a bit off topic but going along with the Master Spy thing, have you ever done a stealth game and, if so, what particular programming challenges do stealth mechanics bring that you don't usually have to deal with?"
    "1:20:54": "Stephenlast Q: Is the syntax of Casey-Lang still very close to C?"
    "1:21:09": "insofaras Q: Your metaprogramming tools sound very useful, will you ever open source them, maybe in your will if nothing else?"
    "1:22:08": "Shoozza Q: Will you write your own installer for Handmade Hero? Or just zip it and be done with it?"
    "1:23:24": "boondoggle42 Q: How about writing a Casey-Approved GUI debugger for Jai?"
    "1:24:15": "JamesWidman Q: I'm looking forward to additional visualizers in the debug view (e.g. a small grid view with a dot or line from (0,0) to represent a v2 along with the decimal digits). Do you think that would be worthwhile?"
    "1:25:28": "garryjohanson Q: Do you ever metaprogram the sims stuff and the job queue?"
    "1:27:31": "vSealos Q: Is there any feature you would add to Jai?"
    "1:30:58": "Close it down"
    "1:33:14": "Announcement: F2P discussion between Casey and Shawn McGrath on Thursday"

    "59:38": "insofaras Q: Have you considered only merging with the hero's region, and deactivating ones past that, or having the regions aligned to a grid / rooms, so they don't overlap?"

    "1:03:03": "terrorscout Q: Could you have smaller regions and load nine active at a time so you always have every boundary region loaded all the time?"

    "1:09:42": "jayphi Q: What is the actual problem again when two active regions overlap?"
    "1:10:55": "Mr4thDimention Q: You could always artificially keep the non-player agents away from each other"
    "1:11:13": "thesizik Q: What do you think about a boolean flag on each update-able thing, flip it when you update, and alternate each frame which value you check for?"
    "1:12:10": "JamesWidman Q: Why does it not suffice to use the total area of all overlapped regions (and just refuse to exceed a limit)?"
    "1:13:40": "Close this down"

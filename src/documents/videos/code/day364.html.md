    "1:30:29": "macielda Q: What is Alpha to Coverage? Any good references on that?"
    "1:31:48": "k1ng_k3v1n Q: Would an orthogonal projection matrix be applicable for your game?"
    "1:32:19": "sharlock93 Q: Is the -n and -f because OpenGL has the camera on the negative -z?"
    "1:33:06": "magik603 Q: Why are you using legacy OpenGL?"
    "1:34:49": "cvaucher Q: Do you typically use an infinite far plane for increased precision? Shawn McGrath mentioned it in his stream awhile back"
    "1:36:20": "macielda Q: Would it be simpler to use Orthographic transforms for upright objects? Are you not simply undoing the Perspective Projection there?"
    "1:37:28": "pepevel Q: Would it be possible to use a shader to do the Z-buffer rendering?"
    "1:40:17": "sharlock93 Q: So the near and far plane are linearly mapped. I have read somewhere where the mapping is not linear, in which case do we not make them linear?"

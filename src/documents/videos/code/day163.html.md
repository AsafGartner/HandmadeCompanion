But now... it seems the STB way is the only reasonable default. I think I'm done with CMake for the foreseeable future"

    "1:12:11": "kknewkles Q: You have used a library, and there are riots raging in the streets. I see shadows of pitchforks, cast by torch lights of the rabid crowd. Run, Casey, I'll do my best to slow them down. \*tips his hat with a last farewell gaze\*"
    "1:12:46": "MannuB Q: How would you write debug info now?"
    "1:12:59": "kknewkles Q: Also, if you make the Hero spew out letters of my nickname at random (at least 'til the end of Q&A (and we already established that I'm the mascot of the community (le lovable goof))), holy hell will I be happy"
    "1:13:20": "argimm Q: I noticed \"mollyrocket\" in one of the comments of the STB file... Did you make contributions?"

    "1:15:08": "kknewkles Q: I'm curious: what do you look at when hiring an artist (I have no idea how you apply for that)? After watching a few episodes of Double Fine Adventure I'm in awe at how good artists at Double Fine seem to be and what kind of *richnesses* you have to have to be one of those. You also seem to practise more intelligent and humane approaches to hiring"

    "1:18:29": "kknewkles Q: I don't look for a practical advice, just interested how you do it now. Often my friends tell me \"I can't give you an objective answer/data\" \"screw it, I want YOUR opinion!\""

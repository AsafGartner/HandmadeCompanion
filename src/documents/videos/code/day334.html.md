    "47:16": "internal_static_void Q: About my first question, will I be able to view it again, because I was really interested about your answer?"
    "47:49": "arigato_corleone Q: Are you using entity component system architecture or different?"
    "49:33": "hida_akano Q: Have you come up with a story for the game yet?"
    "49:45": "dr_s80 Q: I recall when you were writing the head / body behavior code you wanted to ensure the player always had control of the head. Is this \"auto-hopping\" going to interfere with that?"
    "50:46": "sean_bryant Q: Can the player fall in the hole versus jumping on purposes?"
    "51:00": "longboolean Q: In theory could these jump pads be on the same level and used like the jump pads in Portal 2?"
    "52:01": "torgdor Q: Will multi-part entities like the snake be able to go through holes?"
    "53:35": "arigato_corleone Q: What are your thoughts on voxel rendering and / or ray tracing?"
    "57:19": "dr_s80 Q: Regarding head / body, the player controls the head onto the jump pad, but then the game needs to animate both the head and body down, right? I thought so far the head was always responsive to player input (not tied to an animation), and the body just followed. Sorry, I may not be explaining clearly"
    "58:36": "internal_static_void Q: Opinion on Vulkan, other than it being really hard?"
    "1:00:11": "zilarrezko Q: How are holes and teleport pads going to help us find The Variable?"
    "1:01:06": "arigato_corleone Q: Any tips for someone interested in game engines considering getting into the games industry?"
    "1:01:46": "thestraubulous Q: Do you have a set streaming schedule?"
    "1:01:56": "Go right into mentioning the streaming schedule"

    "1:51:51": "Miblo Q: Amazing. I think I followed it, but definitely want to re-watch (during and after annotating)"
    "1:52:04": "garryjohanson Q: Forgive me if this information was somehow implicit in today's lecture and I missed it, but is compression ever used for locality wins?"
    "1:52:43": "graeme7 Q: Do you know off-hand what kind of compression ratio and decompression speed are needed before it's faster to load compressed data and decompress, over loading decompressed data?"
    "1:54:01": "nxsy Q: inttypes.h and PRIu64 is probably what you are supposed to do for %llu for 64-bit printfs"
    "1:54:38": "ieee754 Q: You still have to uncompress your images for display, right? So do you have plans for using block compression?"
    "1:55:16": "garryjohanson Q: Make data fit in cache"
    "1:57:08": "mtsmox Q: Why is 255 not a good look back limit for images? You wanted to elaborate on that"
    "1:57:47": "Blackboard: Choosing your look back window for image compression"
    "1:59:22": "bluespide Q: Have you ever heard of random seed data compression?"
    "1:59:46": "kknewkles Q: Probably more of Jeff and Fabian's territory, but is there generally such a thing as a compressor that compresses a lot and fast? Would some RAD compressor leave 10% of initial size and be considerably faster than LZ? I guess BINK is hyperfast, isn't it like live decompression or something?"
    "2:00:59": "ieee754 Q: I meant block compression that's GPU-supported (BC1-BC7). You upload the compressed image to the GPU, and hardware decodes it when sampled"
    "2:03:43": "Close this off"

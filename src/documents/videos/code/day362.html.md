    "1:53:03": "zilarrezko Q: Can you interpolate if you wanted a smooth rotation about a point or axis over time?"
    "1:54:35": "garryjohanson Q: There have been some problems with trolls causing flame wars in the chat. I forget who you dedicated the management of the chat to? [see Resources, Handmade.Network]"
    "1:55:46": "sahfortv Q: You mentioned (about six months ago, I think) that you have new art work. What's the plan with adding that?"
    "1:56:16": "pepevel Q: Did you know beforehand that you where going to discard the sorting code? Did you do all that for the sake of teaching a variety of techniques?"
    "1:59:18": "frank3434455 Q: Do you know anything about DirectX 12?"
    "2:01:06": "frank3434455 Q: When are you gonna do OOP?"
    "2:02:04": "frank3434455 Q: Ever heard of design patterns?"
    "2:02:25": "frank3434455 Q: Try unit testing your code so we can actually see if something is working"
    "2:04:04": "micahtron Q: Will the Molly Rocket team be at Emerald City Comicon this year?"
    "2:04:11": "snoringtortoise Q: In terms of profiling, how would you tell when you are hitting upper bounds of CPU, PCI Bus and GPU? Obviously, we already have a CPU profiler, wondering more about PCI Bus and GPU"
    "2:05:57": "zennmystic Q: Will you use Vulkan in your game at all, will it still be too new on release, or do some kind of tutorial on it?"
    "2:07:48": "frank3434455 Q: Do you think writing my own ring 0 driver would bypass VAC?"
    "2:09:47": "snoringtortoise Q: Is there any way to do that from our own code, or do we have to rely on external tools? [see Resources, OpenGL]"
    "2:12:18": "graeme7 Q: Near the beginning of the stream the back of my chair fell off. I spent the entire stream fixing my chair. It feels more solid now and squeaks less but I'm afraid to lean back on it?"
    "2:12:55": "snoringtortoise Q: Not sure if anyone has mentioned this but Mac OSX doesn't support OpenGL core profile with OpenGL 1.x functions. This means that, if using glBegin etc, the maximum version of GL allowed is 2.1"
    "2:14:44": "frank3434455 Q: Can you name one of those exploits for my driver? [see Resources, GitHub and YouTube]"
    "2:18:22": "wobbly_bob Q: Can you give Shawn M & Sean B's stream a plug before you go please?"
    "2:19:20": "Plug Shawn, Sean and Jon's streams [see Resources, Twitch]"
    "2:20:51": "frank3434455 Q: Would ring 0 driver bypass the anti cheat protection of Destiny"
    "2:22:19": "insofaras Q: Sean and Shawn are doing a specific stream today [see Resources, Twitter]"
    "2:23:04": "frank3434455 Q: How do I read the RAM memory on an XBox or PS4?"
    "2:27:44": "snoringtortoise Q: I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this but in the cutscene shot 6, layer 3 and 4 are both at z=3.0f. Layer 3 should be at ~z-3.01f instead. Layer 4 is the child's tears and layer 3 is the child"
    "2:30:25": "desuused Q: Will the order of matrix multiplication be reversed if we use transposed matrices and vectors?"
    "2:31:04": "Blackboard: Multiplying a matrix and a vector"
    "2:35:03": "desuused Q: Yes, that's what I was asking. Earlier in the video you said that matrix application order is unintuitive, and this way we can reverse the order [see Resources, Wikipedia]"

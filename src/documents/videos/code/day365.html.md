    "2:05:00": "macielda Q: Maybe if you swap the order of the sum on 'tb = ...' you get an equation more similar to 'ta = ...'?"

    "2:06:03": "vaualbus Q: Can you show again the equation?"

    "2:07:31": "insobot Q: 1935 is Molly Rocket's upcoming volitional fiction game, set in the criminal underworld of New York City in the 1930s [see Resources, Molly Rocket]"
    "2:07:37": "pepevel Q: As Handmade Hero is a 2D game, my idea would be to treat the z variable not as the z coordinate but as a variable that the pixel shader will use to kill hidden pixels and do alpha blending with the GPU power"
    "2:10:28": "macielda Q: Are you doing this so you can mix perspective projection and orthographic projection for game objects?"
    "2:11:31": "rooctag Q: Now we have the alpha issue with the 3D stuff, is this easier to fix than the 2D sort because you already know how to fix that?"
    "2:13:32": "vaualbus Q: This could be the solutiun at least for Matlab: [ta = -(Pax*rby - Pay*rbx - Pbx*rby + Pby*rbx)/(rax*rby - ray*rbx), tb = -(Pax*ray - Pay*rax - Pbx*ray + Pby*rax)/(rax*rby - ray*rbx)]"

    "2:03:9": "quikligames Q: There was a lot of chat about Wolfram expecting 1-letter variable names and interpreting rbx as r * b * x"
    "2:03:23": "billdstrong Q: Didn't we do this math when doing the screen projection?"
    "2:04:12": "Miblo Q: Do you think we needed an epilepsy warning there?"
    "2:04:44": "pepevel Q: Hello, yesterday I was asking about shaders and the z-buffer. Could I rephrase the question? It will be the last time"
    "2:05:00": "macielda Q: Maybe if you swap the order of the sum on 'tb = ...' you get an equation more similar to 'ta = ...'?"
    "2:05:26": "handmade_math.h: Try swapping the order of the sum in RayIntersect2()"
    "2:06:03": "vaualbus Q: Can you show again the equation?"
    "2:07:11": "zennmystic Q: Is the stream weekends only now or is it temp thing?"
    "2:07:31": "insobot Q: 1935 is Molly Rocket's upcoming volitional fiction game, set in the criminal underworld of New York City in the 1930s [see Resources, Molly Rocket]"
    "2:07:37": "pepevel Q: As Handmade Hero is a 2D game, my idea would be to treat the z variable not as the z coordinate but as a variable that the pixel shader will use to kill hidden pixels and do alpha blending with the GPU power"
    "2:10:28": "macielda Q: Are you doing this so you can mix perspective projection and orthographic projection for game objects?"
    "2:11:31": "rooctag Q: Now we have the alpha issue with the 3D stuff, is this easier to fix than the 2D sort because you already know how to fix that?"
    "2:13:32": "vaualbus Q: This could be the solutiun at least for Matlab: [ta = -(Pax*rby - Pay*rbx - Pbx*rby + Pby*rbx)/(rax*rby - ray*rbx), tb = -(Pax*ray - Pay*rax - Pbx*ray + Pby*rax)/(rax*rby - ray*rbx)]"
    "2:17:57": "handmade_render_group.cpp: Make PushBitmap() use CardRyz to set the YAxis"
    "2:18:24": "Run the game to see that we're surprisingly good"
    "2:20:01": "macielda Q: It seems like @vaualbus' solution is negated in relation to yours"
    "2:23:14": "handmade_render_group.cpp: Enable PushBitmap() to produce a standard sprite card and run the game to see that"
    "2:25:14": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Temporarily make OpenGLRenderCommands() clip out all transparent pixels, and run the game"
    "2:27:47": "Consider addressing transparency in the sort, and close it down"

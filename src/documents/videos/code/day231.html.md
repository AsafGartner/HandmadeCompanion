    "1:14:56": "quartertron Q: NP stands for Nondeterministic Polynomial. Plus some other minor problems. Otherwise, well done"
    "1:16:39": "cubercaleb Q: For the record the remark I made earlier about Rust was not serious. Also, isn't mergesort n*log(n)?"
    "1:17:08": "Longboolean Q: So unit testing a function that computes a path for the traveling salesman problem would require writing the algorithm twice, the second one testing the first?"
    "1:18:04": "fiveshot97 Q: Do you think a computer science major is a good path to go? I'm in it now"
    "1:19:05": "insofaras Q: You say \"exponential\""
    "1:19:08": "Busy_Beaver Q: To say that a problem is not solvable in polynomial time, you just say \"The problem is not in P\""
    "1:21:12": "cmuratori Q: Has anyone definitively proven that Travelling Salesman could not be in P, or is that still potentially NP-hard?"
    "1:22:44": "Busy_Beaver Q: TSP is NP-complete, so it is also in NP, so it DOES have a polynomial verifier"
    "1:23:12": "cmuratori Q: Have they proven that it doesn't have a P verifier?"
    "1:25:33": "Busy_Beaver Q: Well it depends which TSP problem we are actually talking about"
    "1:26:44": "quiensab3 Q: Wouldn't saying that something is \"NINPY\" imply that P != NP? (Did we win a $1M prize?)"
    "1:27:05": "Blackboard: \"in P\" / \"not in P\" vs \"NP-complete\""
    "1:30:42": "Longboolean Q: Idea: The game should include a traveling salesman, who ponders these things..."
    "1:30:54": "cubercaleb Q: Will we go into more complex sort algorithms like radix sort? Also, is the space requirement of mergesort something that needs to be take into consideration for Handmade Hero?"
    "1:31:45": "quartertron Q: Since you didn't go to college, when did you first get interested in or at least start learning all about big O?"
    "1:33:25": "insofaras Q: I'm not sure we can prove something is not in P unless it is undecidable or we can prove P != NP"
    "1:33:54": "Connor_Rentz Q: By the way, 8^2 doesn't equal 16"
    "1:37:31": "quartertron Q: I shall dig through my copy of Computers and Intractability by Gary and Johnson tonight"
    "1:37:41": "quartertron Q: Hmm, first sentence contains the word whimsical so it's looking good so far"
    "1:38:09": "Wrap up with a recap"

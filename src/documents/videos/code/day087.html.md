    "52:04": "jazzy_josh Q: Are the randomly generated floor tiles being cached yet?"
    "52:20": "freddukes Q: Do you think having things in place like static cast to put more checks, e.g. int to pointer, is useful over standard C-style cast which just ignores all type-checking? Wouldn't a static cast have found that bug at the start of the stream?"
    "55:29": "QuickliGames Q: Do you think the clumpiness is actually due to splat distance from the centre of the chunks?"
    "57:20": "cdawzrd Q: Do you know why the trees are wiggling around sometimes?"
    "59:03": "cezonezor Q: What is causing the lag?"
    "1:01:12": "maato_ Q: Are there still places where the background colour shows through the ground tiles?"
    "1:02:39": "cmbasckeira Q: Is this Chunk code already prepared for adding holes to the ground?"
    "1:07:01": "insofaras Q: Could you make code that ensures a certain frame-rate but uses extra available time to generate the ground textures in the background, maybe generating a low-quality version first to avoid having no texture at all?"
    "1:08:58": "Recap, a glimpse into the future and closing remarks"

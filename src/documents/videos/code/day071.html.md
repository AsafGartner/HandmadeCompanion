    "58:51": "plainflavored Q: Have you considered using macros that take a name and operator to paste in simple vector functions?"
    "1:00:02": "llorton Q: What kind of almond milk are you drinking?"
    "1:00:12": "donotputmeonpizza Q: Do you have any suggestions on how to keep up with your 5 episodes a week, when me and my friend have only started watching your videos from the beginning last week?"
    "1:01:22": "ryanries Q: Why type 1.0f instead of 1.0?"
    "1:02:28": "hexagonal_diamond Q: Have you considered writing tests?"
    "1:05:36": "rsxole Q: Can you explain what your Z really means? If it's for separating levels, should tall walls be able to poke into the upper Z layer(s)?"
    "1:06:36": "Reminder: Monster that you fight on two floors at once, going up and down stairs to fight the bottom or the top"
    "1:07:34": "xanthacroi Q: How do you tab between things so quickly?"
    "1:08:39": "mickeyd32 Q: How good of a computer do I need to smoothly code?"
    "1:10:19": "saltattack Q: I love you... Will you marry me?"
    "1:10:36": "nathyks Q: How smooth is it transitioning a knowledge of Python into C++"
    "1:11:26": "apathydude Q: Have you thought more on how the Z-axis will look when finally implemented?"
    "1:12:35": "biralx Q: When you work on a game do you work on one project or do they contract you for multiple projects?"
    "1:12:50": "nicstop Q: Do you think about data locality all the time, to reduce cache misses?"
    "1:14:37": "jkr2120 Q: How long have you been programming?"
    "1:14:50": "plainshane Q: Are you done working for real - made all your money, and this is just for fun / philanthropic reasons?"
    "1:15:10": "duroate Q: How do you determine what gathers in a chunk with the Z-axis? Do you grab entities from all 6 sides of the chunk?"
    "1:15:27": "Blackboard: \"Axis aligned bounding box\""
    "1:18:11": "handmade.h: TODO(casey): Minkowski inclusion test for sim region begin / updateable bounds"
    "1:19:28": "hnau Q: I recently watched Jon Blow's talk on attempting deep work and became curious: Do you do anything similar from a psychological perspective, i.e. go dancing like Jon does or do you have some other relaxing / rewarding activity that helps to spawn creative thought or gain elusive insights into problems you are struggling to solve?"
    "1:21:08": "drtwox Q: Do you think RK4 integration is \"overkill\" for a 2D game like Handmade Hero?"
    "1:24:25": "mymlyreen Q: Hi, just tuned in so it might have been mentioned before, but why are you using assertions in non-test code?"
    "1:29:38": "d7samurai Q: What about having two regions - one outer and one inner, include entities that move into the inner and exclude entities that move out of the outer - so there's a \"margin\" that allows some moving without ping-ponging right across a hard in / out line?"
    "1:31:13": "Call it"

    "6:30": "Allocating debug_frame_regions"
    "7:55": "Testing. We are running out of debugging memory"
    "9:00": "What is the cause of that error? Are we processing too many frames?"
    "9:55": "We were treating the whole event array as if it was populated with real events!"
    "10:21": "The game runs now"
    "10:44": "(Blackboard) Problems we will face while pairing begin and end events"
    "15:22": "We will identify the events with a combination of their thread and counter ids. We will pair them using a stack"

    "50:30": "Testing. The game seems to loop forever and hang"
    "51:13": "The bug was that we were not initializing the thread id"
    "52:00": "Still not running correctly"
    "53:35": "After increasing the amount of top-level regions per frame, the program works but runs really slowly and does not show the debug bars"
    "54:03": "Stepping through the code"
    "54:31": "Keeping the largest FrameBarScale to scale our debug bars"
    "57:34": "The scale for drawing seems wrong"
    "59:06": "Let's hardcode the FrameBarScale for the moment for debugging purposes"
    "1:00:22": "The debug visualization is still not showing properly"

    "1:05:38": "insofaras Q: Is there still going to be a debug visualization of the asset memory chunks?"
    "1:06:01": "XEnDash Q: Can you make a mini episode about project management, outsourcing, freelance hiring, etc.? Programming is great but making a game takes more. If not, can you point to good resources on the topic?"
    "1:06:20": "elxenoaizd Q: Do you use the same memory model as in HMH when writing utilities or meta programs, or do you just malloc and it wouldn't matter because the thing runs once, does its thing and closes?"
    "1:08:32": "Culver_Fly Q: What are the pros / cons of viewing debugging information real time vs logging them and viewing them after the fact?"
    "1:12:21": "abnercoimbre Q: Off-topic. People want you to actually drink chocolate wine some time. Are you up for it?"
    "1:12:49": "duel1000 Q: Are you going to IndieCade in Culver City? Would you recommend it?"
    "1:13:03": "elxenoaizd Q: Thank you very much for mentioning cmirror. It addresses a lot of my issues directly and is much more human readable. What was the GetToken written for? For config files? Doesn't seem like for C code"
    "1:13:44": "XEnDash Q: How will you debug the OpenGL / Direct3D stuff when you will ship?"
    "1:16:13": "davidthomas426 Q: Did I misunderstand mollyrocket.com update, or should there be a comic there today having something to do with your project? (!quote 234)"
    "1:17:50": "Wrap up here"

* 232\. Tired Casey (37:41)
* 233\. I overate yesterday. There was a lot of food consumed. Just not really the right amount of food for a single Casey to be eating (37:48)
* 234\. I'm still ironing out CSS issues (1:16:13)

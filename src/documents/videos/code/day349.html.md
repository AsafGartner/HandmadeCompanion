markers:
    "0:14": "Recap and set the stage for the day"
    "1:42": "Run the game and consider the plan for implementing multiple sim regions"
    "5:47": "handmade_world_mode.cpp: Consider how the UpdateAndRender*() functions are currently operating, and whether or not to split them up"
    "11:24": "handmade_brain.cpp: Look into why RenderGroup gets passed down to the brain"
    "12:45": "handmade_brain.cpp: Prevent ExecuteBrain() from setting AlwaysBehind and AlwaysInFrontOf, and run the game to see how the body and head are sorted"
    "14:21": "handmade_world_mode.cpp: Carve off the rendering code in UpdateAndRenderSimRegion() and determine which of its arguments may be optional"
    "21:31": "handmade_entity.cpp: Do that same process for UpdateAndRenderEntities()"
    "26:10": "handmade_world_mode.cpp: Run the game, then toggle off the rendering in UpdateAndRenderWorld()"
    "27:05": "handmade_brain.cpp: Make ExecuteBrain() only run the controller code if it has an Input"
    "30:34": "handmade_world_mode.cpp: Make UpdateAndRenderSimRegion() only process the mouse if it has Input"
    "32:41": "handmade_world_mode.cpp: Make UpdateAndRenderWorld() call UpdateAndRenderSimRegion() twice, run the game and see what happens"
    "35:38": "handmade_world_mode.cpp: Make UpdateAndRenderWorld() do an UpdateAndRenderSimRegion() on a second region"
    "36:58": "Run the game and zoom out to see two regions being simulated"
    "38:16": "Q&A"
    "39:28": "f1aw Q: Did you make that debug UI yourself?"
    "40:12": "nyeecola Q: Have you thought about refactoring your \"brain\" code to make use of virtual methods? Switch statements on \"type\" is basically replicating the type system and is a bit of a code smell"
    "44:16": "montify Q: Do you use keyboard only at your day job? Are you faster without the mouse?"
    "44:58": "nxsy Q: I missed the reason the two areas on the screen are discontinuous. Are these two sim regions of a larger world?"
    "45:26": "Run the game in -O2 and traverse the world towards the other sim region"
    "47:42": "longboolean Q: What do you think about changing float values in the debug system by the distance you drag? Example: longer drag distance == bigger increments / decrements of the value, shorter drag distance == smaller increment / decrements"
    "49:04": "nambitable Q: Couldn't you use CMake to generate visual studio solutions for windows?"
    "50:36": "septumtesseract Q: What books do you recommend for C programming?"
    "51:41": "soysaucethekid Q: How about for learning OpenGL? [see Resources, Arc Synthesis]"
    "53:40": "Plug Nsight [see Resources, NVIDIA]"
    "55:56": "dandymcgee Q: \"RenderDoc\" is a pretty amazing tool, and I've found it to be more compatible than Nsight [see Resources, GitHub]"
    "57:06": "Wind it down"
    "58:06": "Announcement: A potential change in the format"

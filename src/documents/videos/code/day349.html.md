    "39:28": "f1aw Q: Did you make that debug UI yourself?"
    "40:12": "nyeecola Q: Have you thought about refactoring your \"brain\" code to make use of virtual methods? Switch statements on \"type\" is basically replicating the type system and is a bit of a code smell"
    "44:16": "montify Q: Do you use keyboard only at your day job? Are you faster without the mouse?"
    "44:58": "nxsy Q: I missed the reason the two areas on the screen are discontinuous. Are these two sim regions of a larger world?"
    "45:26": "Run the game in -O2 and traverse the world towards the other sim region"
    "47:42": "longboolean Q: What do you think about changing float values in the debug system by the distance you drag? Example: longer drag distance == bigger increments / decrements of the value, shorter drag distance == smaller increment / decrements"
    "49:04": "nambitable Q: Couldn't you use CMake to generate visual studio solutions for windows?"
    "50:36": "septumtesseract Q: What books do you recommend for C programming?"

    "53:40": "Plug Nsight [see Resources, NVIDIA]"
    "55:56": "dandymcgee Q: \"RenderDoc\" is a pretty amazing tool, and I've found it to be more compatible than Nsight [see Resources, GitHub]"

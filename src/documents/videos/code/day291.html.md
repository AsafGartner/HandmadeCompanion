## Quotes

* 489\. It's tractable, it's small enough that you could learn it, it was not this giant splatter of garbage that's just smeared all over the walls like some kind of lunatic asylum where they're trying to keep the poop from sticking to the padded cell or whatever like it is now (1:11:56)

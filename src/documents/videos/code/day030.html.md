    "1:10:48": "Q&A"
    "1:11:52": "Question: Can you talk about the inline keyword? Do you apply any strategies to make sure the compiler does not ignore the request?"
    "1:13:13": "Question: Are we using C or C++?"
    "1:14:47": "Question: How did we start the code for the game?"
    "1:15:07": "Question: What's so bad about including math.h?"
    "1:15:54": "Question: Why not substract 1 if input is under 0, instead of using floor()?"
    "1:17:09": "Question: I thought integers were faster to compute than floats, even if the cpu has a floating-point unit."
    "1:19:43": "Question: How do you decide when to pack things in a struct?"
    "1:27:28": "Question: Why would we care about screen coordinates? Isn't that just platform code."
    "1:29:26": "Question: Are you going to make walls obstruct the player the same way the player currently obstructs the walls?"
    "1:30:17": "Question: Can you explain the raw_position and canonical_position again?"
    "1:32:16": "Question: Instead of checking three points on the player, wouldn't it be better to check only the side the player is moving towards?"
    "1:34:39": "Question: Why not have a single set of coordinates for the player that maps the player to a world position?"
    "1:42:14": "Question: Are there any consequences of using inline in early development, i.e harder debugging?"
    "1:43:22": "Question: Wouldn't it be better to call the X and Y variables something more descriptive?"
    "1:45:52": "Question: The game will happen in whole screens without any scrolling or camera movement?"
    "1:48:13": "Question: Could you explain how pointers/references are working or what you use them for and why?"
    "1:49:02": "Question: Was there ever a point in your career where you used these unfortunate structure packing practices?"

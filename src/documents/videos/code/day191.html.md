    "1:07:57": "ijustwantfood Q: Why did you use radial menu over list or another format?"
    "1:08:24": "elxenoaizd Q: It would be cool if the menu items are aligned with the circle borders, that way there's less chance of the text colliding"
    "1:08:38": "elxenoaizd Q: You mentioned C doesn't officially support closures. Did you ever make an attempt to hack it, maybe via 'functors' or something like that?"
    "1:09:00": "ScorpionResponse Q: Have you ever considered a debug output for the stream where we can see your keystrokes?"
    "1:09:23": "Anticipate mr4thdimention's editor 4coder"
    "1:09:42": "elxenoaizd Q: Oftentimes when using somebody else's API / engine you end up having to 'fight' with it to have it do what you want from it. Do you think that is a sign that one should leave that API and try another / write his own instead of 'fighting' all the time?"
    "1:15:18": "powerc9k Q: Are you ready for the world to end tomorrow as predicted by crazy Christians?"
    "1:15:33": "Psi9 Q: Since draw rectangle quickly is in its own translation unit, are you going to write that code in straight ASM instead of C / intrinsics?"
    "1:15:50": "cubercaleb Q: Wait, isn't 4coder already better than Emacs?"
    "1:16:10": "cubercaleb Q: Can you go into detail on I/O Completion Ports since you brought them up?"
    "1:16:25": "Wind it down"

## Quotes

* 251\. I might try something, like, epically ridiculous. Like, something so ridiculous that it just has no right working (1:31)
* 250\. Since we don't really have anything better to do with our lives or ourselves, we will just do something like this (53:37)

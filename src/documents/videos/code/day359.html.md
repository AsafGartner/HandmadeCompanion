Here, p0 = (x, y, z, 1) and p1 = (2x, 2y, 2z, 2) represent the same point in space (but p1 = 2 * p0 mathematically speaking). Therefore the usage of homogeneous coordinates and homogeneous matrices here"

    "2:05:25": "elxenoaizd Q: I was reading the article from Fabian about his optimizations on the Intel software renderer and I saw him doing the clipping in a very simple manner in screenspace, where he takes the min / max between the pixel and screen dimensions because he was using orient2d and barycentric coordinates to rasterize. The clipping was only four lines of code and easy to understand. Why does OpenGL have to do complicated homogeneous clipping? [see Resources, The ryg blog]"
    "2:07:58": "rivten Q: In practice, does the camera near plane and the camera focal length really differ? I would expect them to be the same"
    "2:10:37": "elxenoaizd Q: Are we going to continue supporting the software renderer in 3D as well?"
    "2:11:07": "elxenoaizd Q: If I set the near clip plane to, say, 10, does that mean that entities with a world space Z less than 10 would be clipped? Just trying to make sure that near / far clip planes are defined in terms of world space"
    "2:13:35": "elxenoaizd Q: Can you use the GPU to bypass the OpenGL or DirectX API / pipeline and just use compute shaders to implement your own pipeline that's also running on the GPU?"
    "2:16:51": "rivten Q: So, to avoid Z fighting, should we have dynamical near / far planes? I mean that their values should change according to the nearest and the farthest objects we want to render in order for the near / far plane space to be as small as possible? [see Resources, MSDN]"
    "2:22:50": "elxenoaizd Q: Does any of that clip and projection math change if we change the rendering technique that we're using? Say, rasterizing vs raytracing or voxels"
    "2:26:40": "Close out"

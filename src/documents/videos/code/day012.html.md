Key ideas:

- Sound is necessarily temporal. You can drop a frame of video and the user probably won't notice, but if your audio
  drops out, they probably will notice.
- Sound bufers are small, and not all platforms will require us to deal with circular buffers. So one option is to do
  a buffer copy per frame and present the game with a contiguous block of memory. This should be cheap enough.
- Much like the bitmap, allocate plenty of space for a sound buffer at startup, and reuse it each frame.

## C features

### alloca

`alloca` is a compiler feature that allows for dynamic allocation *on the stack*. Much was learned and discussed, but
it should be noted that the function is deprecated and probably shouldn't be used in shipping code.

    "1:50:51": "anonymous519 Q: What if I want my game to be deterministic, or what if my game does physics calculations and I need to update at a fixed rate for stability. Different people have different monitors with different refresh rates. Most people seem to then interpolate but this adds latency. Isn't mailboxing the better approach in this situation?"

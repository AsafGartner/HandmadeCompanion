    "1:00:59": "twitch_makes_me_itch Q: Do I need the payed version of Mischief to change the background color?"
    "1:01:29": "evraire Q: Will you try rotation to visually compare against shearing before deciding?"
    "1:02:26": "cvaucher Q: You wrote the scale / shear this way because it's already done in the software renderer but these transformations would usually be done in a vertex shader, right?"
    "1:03:52": "novynn Q: Some other games have done similar move styles, but they use a floating indicator instead of separating the head from the body. Your thoughts?"
    "1:04:06": "soysaucethekid Q: For collision detection will there be skewed boxes as well or will it just be AABB?"
    "1:04:35": "garlandobloom Q: So we move tile to tile? Haven't seen the new movement"
    "1:04:46": "erdomina Q: Are we eventually going to move these over to shaders?"
    "1:06:23": "garryjohanson Q: Any word on the new debugger?"
    "1:07:09": "garryjohanson Q: You had a stream about someone contacting you about making a debugger"
    "1:08:50": "insofaras Q: I doubt the concept of shaders is going anywhere soon"
    "1:12:57": "Miblo Q: Do you think you'll use the spring code from the other day on the camera movement? I'm imagining a critically damped spring would be the thing to use for that"
    "1:15:26": "garlandobloom Q: For camera stuff I just do x += (x - dest) / 10 or something like that. What would that be?"
    "1:16:20": "garlandobloom Q: That's not accounting for t, that's if it was instantaneous"
    "1:17:28": "Mr4thDimention Q: Should be (dest - x) I'm assuming"
    "1:17:42": "garlandobloom Q: I used to do like fixed FPS, so it was fine, but I've changed. Hold on I'll look it up"
    "1:18:04": "Blackboard: GarlandoBloom's camera movement"
    "1:21:06": "jim0_o Q: Plans on adding camera shake or blur or similar if the hero gets hit or a bolder hits the ground near the hero?"
    "1:22:04": "Wrap it up"

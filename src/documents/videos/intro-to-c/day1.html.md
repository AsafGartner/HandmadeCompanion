##Updates

Since this video was released, Microsoft has made [Visual Studio Community 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs)
available for free to small teams. Since it is much closer to the Professional version of the tools, using it is
recommended over the Express Editions discussed here.

markers:
    "0:00:20": "Q&A Start"
    "0:00:22": "Do a segmentation error! -Braincruzer"
    "0:00:38": "Will you explain how negative numbers are encoded? -chronaldragon"
    "0:01:06": "What would be the difference if you used c++ classes instead of structs? -chronaldragon"
    "0:02:16": "Does the order of variable declaration affect their memory packing?"
    "0:02:56": "Show a segmentation error"
    "0:03:06": "Why are their 18 columns in the memory window?"
    "0:04:06": "Why use char and short if they get padded to 32 bits like ints anyway?"
    "0:09:03": "In case you weren't aware, the twitch stream doesn't stop when you kill the webcam video"
    "0:09:21": "What is the arrow operator?"
    "0:09:46": "Why didn't big endianness become the thing instead of little endianess? Conversely, if Sony is in a world where little endianness is dominant in x86, why would they make things harder for everyone by chosing big endiannes for the ps3? -idiocracy"
    "0:17:50": "Aren't the sizes of short, int, and long determined by the CPU and memory architecture rather than always being 16-bits 32-bits etcettera?" 
    "0:18:25": "After the pragma on the struct you could rearrange declarations so it's 11 bytes but on 3 of the 4 32-bit bounderies..."
    "0:18:49": "How do you feel about functional programming?"
    "0:18:56": "Is there a difference between combining multiple statements into a single line in the resulting code or is it just to save on typing?"
    "0:19:40": "Is there a particular reason you cast the projectile pointer to a char pointer instead of an int?"
    "0:21:03": "I don't know about the packing. I'm pretty sure it just puts the variable at an address in memory that is a multiple of that variables size."
    "0:21:33": "Will Q&A continue when you start the main series?"
    "0:21:38": "I'm new here. What is the goal of your stream and are you streaming stuff like this again?"
    "0:21:56": "If pointers are always point to one byte, why are there ever any types besides unsigned char?"
    "0:22:41": "Couldn't it[the platform decision] also be to make emulation harder?"
    "0:22:50": "Yesterday you said why you plan to use visual studio as only a debugger, but you wouldn't be using the editor. What will you be using to edit code/compile if not using visual studio?" -
    "0:23:46": "What are these dword, word, and qword things in the win32api? I know they're typedefs so I'm asking why they exist."
    "0:24:50": "Not really directly related to the content of the stream, but do you think c++ has beaten c as the standard for game programming?" -
    "0:25:36": "How do you psychologically deal with not having visceral results for something you've been programming for a long time?"
    "0:26:16": "You should really put a link to the handmade hero website in the twitch pages description."
    "0:26:41": "What do you think about rust for game development? Have you tried it out yet?"
    "0:27:02": "Not sure you covered pointer dereference, but that would solve some arrow operator questions people were asking."
    "0:28:00": "In the past video you seem to dislike microsoft substantially. What do you think of many of their new open-source free initiatives announced recently? -quantumplation"
    "0:31:20": "Thank you and closing thoughts"

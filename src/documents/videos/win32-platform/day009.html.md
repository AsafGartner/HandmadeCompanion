    "1:10:07": "In D this bug couldn't have happened. D always initializes variables."
    "1:13:36": "How do you know that ByteToLock is far enough ahead of the PlayCursor?"
    "1:15:40": "Try [compiling with] -W3 or -W4"
    "1:15:54": "Where do I look for standard C library docs?"
    "1:16:39": "I think you can now remove the ByteToLock == PlayCursor case."
    "1:17:58": "Will we use the sin() in the actyal game?"
    "1:18:07": "Is autocomplete/intellisense a bad idea? You don't seem to use it."
    "1:19:25": "Re-explaining the last bug"
    "1:20:50": "Is it possible for bits to spill over into neighboring variables? For example, when shifting."
    "1:26:26": "Will we use the same output buffer to overlay several sounds?"
    "1:26:33": "Change tone frequency based on input, and the bug will resurface."
    "1:26:37": "Casey: That's a different bug, lets look at it."

    "1:42:49": "If we could live with a slightly less accurate sin, we could approximate it with polynomials."
    "1:45:08": "Will the art and audio be released into the public domain?"
    "1:46:20": "Is it a good idea to use fixed point math for games that require deterministic simulation for multiplayer? Or can you use floating point across systems?"
    "1:48:48": "Sometimes you use 'bool' and sometimes 'bool32'"
    "1:49:30": "Are you going to use etw(sp?) to log context switches for the game?"

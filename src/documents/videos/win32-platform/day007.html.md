###Input Cleanup and Fixes

This episode starts with some cleanup and fixes to the input handling code from yesterday.

- Windows API often uses a `0` return value to indicate success. Our stubs probably shouldn't return `0`.
- Windows 8 ships with `xinput1_4.dll` only. So we need to try each version in turn
- When you handle WM_SYSKEY* messages, you lose built in Alt-F4 functionality, and have to reimplement it.

###Sound Programming for Games

Casey starts with a high level overview of sound programing for games. The key ideas here are that we are allocating a [circular buffer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) for sound, and the system will play it continually on a loop. If you haven't worked with circular buffers (or ring buffers) before, much of this code will be confusing. It's worth taking some time to familiarize yourself with them.

###Working with DirectSound

The basic process for initializing DirectSound is as follows:

1. Load the Library - `LoadLibrary("dsound.dll")`
2. Create a DirectSound object - `DirectSoundCreate()` ([docs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/microsoft.directx_sdk.reference.directsoundcreate8.aspx))
3. Set the Cooperative Level - `IDirectSound8::SetCooperativeLevel()` ([docs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/microsoft.directx_sdk.idirectsound8.idirectsound8.setcooperativelevel.aspx))
4. "Create" a primary buffer - `IDirectSound8::CreateSoundBuffer()` ([docs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/microsoft.directx_sdk.idirectsound8.idirectsound8.createsoundbuffer.aspx))
5. Create a secondary buffer
6. Tell DirectSound to start playing the secondary buffer - `IDirectSoundBuffer8::Play()` ([docs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.directx_sdk.idirectsoundbuffer8.idirectsoundbuffer8.play.aspx))

In the next episode we will look closely at how to fill this buffer and implement it in the game loop

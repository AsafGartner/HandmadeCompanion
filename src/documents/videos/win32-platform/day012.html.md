Key ideas:

- Sound is more temporal video. you can drop a frame of video and the user will probably not notice, but if your audio dropt out, they will probably notice.
- Sound bufers are small, and not all platforms require we deal with circular buffers. So one option is to suffer a buffer copy per frame and present the game with a contiguous block of memory.

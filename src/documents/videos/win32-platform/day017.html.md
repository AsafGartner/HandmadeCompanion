    "1:02:50": "Check the array in the Buttons union, you might want 12 now that you've added start and back"
    "1:08:54": "Is that some copypasta, or is it really supposed to be all MoveLefts?"
    "1:11:24": "Could it be good to apply some integration on the keys, so we don't just set the value to binary -1/1?"
    "1:12:56": "Can you talk about the deadzone being round vs rectangular at hardware USB, HID, and XInput API layers?"
    "1:19:15": "Maybe it's a round deadzone?"
    "1:23:40": "I'm 16 days behind, is there a better way to catch up than watching all the days on YouTube?"
    "1:24:22": "For the build.bat, you can build for Windows XP 64-bit using 5.2 instead of 5.1"
    "1:24:33": "On the inline method for GetController(), what happens if you pass in -1 for index?"
    "1:25:50": "Can you do struct buttons_type (name the structure) and still get the benefits..?"
    "1:26:39": "I don't get using Win32 prefix for function names when compiling for 64-bit."
    "1:27:34": "I was thinking about processing game input in a separate thread so it is framerate independent, but I heard you could introduce input lag. Is that true?"
    "1:28:46": "You said a circular deadzone would be good for gameplay, why don't you just make it circular? The deadzone would just be a little bit bigger."
    "1:32:02": "DirectInput vs XInput, which is better?"
    "1:33:17": "You deleted the Min/Max macro TODO..."
    "1:34:03": "So when you use the ZeroController, why not just go *NewKeyboardController = {}?"
    "1:35:29": "stddef should include offsetof(), you can use that to make your assert a little simpler."
    "1:37:56": "Final Wrap-Up"

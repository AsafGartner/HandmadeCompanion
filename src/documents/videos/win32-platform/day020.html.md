    "2:30:29": "Will this audio system be able to handle music and sound, or will the game have to mux the audio for us?"
    "2:31:08": "How will you make sure that you don't have regressions in some parts that are not that easy to spot right away?"
    "2:32:39": "Why is the pitch of the sound changing after the game has been running a little while?"
    "2:31:54": "I'm sorry if I'm being slow, but I still don't truly understand why exactly the audio is jumping. It just seems like we should be able to handle it more simply."
    "2:39:55": "Callback to earlier half of question: (I'm sorry if I'm being slow, but I don't truly understand why the audio is skipping.) The original audio skipped when we moved the latency to be inside of three frames."
    "2:42:25": "If it's not too much of an issue, can we have line numbers on the side when you are coding so we can get a grip of where you are."
    "2:43:08": "It's more likely to be the accumulation of a small value onto a larger value that is a numerical problem. Mantissas not lining up."
    "2:44:03": "Wrap-up"

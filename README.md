## Contributing
You can add a new video or edit a page for one by editing the corresponding **\*.html.md** file in **src/documents/videos/\*/**

If you want to do more than that, read NOTES.md

Pull requests are more than welcome.

## Running Locally

We use [DocPad](https://docpad.org/) as a build tool to produce a static html site. If you would like to set up a build environment for local testing, its pretty simple.

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. Run `npm install` to grab docpad and other build dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to launch a local test server.
4. Point your browser at the test server.

The test server will monitor the source for changes, and will regenerate and cause the browser to automatically refresh.
